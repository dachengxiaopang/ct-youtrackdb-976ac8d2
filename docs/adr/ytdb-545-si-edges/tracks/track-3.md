## Steps

- [x] Step 1: Prefix lookup helper in SharedLinkBagBTree
  > **What was done:** Added `findCurrentEntry(AtomicOperation, long ridBagId,
  > int targetCollection, long targetPosition)` to `SharedLinkBagBTree`.
  > Searches with `EdgeKey(ridBagId, tc, tp, Long.MIN_VALUE)` via `findBucket`,
  > checks the entry at the insertion point, and falls back to the right
  > sibling's first entry when the insertion point falls at the bucket
  > boundary. Extracted `checkEntryPrefix` helper for the 3-field match check.
  > 19 tests covering empty tree, boundary ts values, non-matching prefixes,
  > tombstones, first/last entries, post-split lookups (200-500 entries), and
  > each individual field-mismatch branch.
  >
  > **Key files:** `SharedLinkBagBTree.java` (modified),
  > `SharedLinkBagBTreeFindCurrentEntryTest.java` (new)

- [x] Step 2: SharedLinkBagBTree.put() with snapshot preservation
  > **What was done:** Modified `put()` to detect cross-transaction updates
  > via `findCurrentEntryInternal` prefix lookup. When an existing entry has
  > a different ts, the old version is preserved in snapshot + visibility
  > indexes via `preserveInSnapshot`, then removed via `removeEntryByKey`,
  > before the standard insert logic runs. Same-ts overwrites skip snapshot
  > preservation. Extracted `findCurrentEntryInternal` from `findCurrentEntry`
  > for use within write operations (no `executeReadOperation` wrapper).
  > Added `crossTxReplacement` flag to override `put()` return value.
  > 8 tests covering new inserts, cross-tx updates (snapshot verification,
  > tree size, multiple sequential updates), same-ts overwrites, independent
  > edge preservation, tombstone preservation, and post-split cross-tx updates.
  >
  > **What was discovered:** Cross-transaction updates must be tested across
  > separate atomic operations (matching production semantics). Within a single
  > uncommitted atomic operation, `findCurrentEntryInternal` cannot find
  > entries written by a previous `put()` call because B-tree page reads
  > within `calculateInsideComponentOperation` don't see uncommitted writes
  > from the same operation. This is correct behavior — in production, the
  > initial insert is always committed before a cross-tx update happens.
  >
  > **Key files:** `SharedLinkBagBTree.java` (modified),
  > `SharedLinkBagBTreePutSITest.java` (new)

- [x] Step 3: SharedLinkBagBTree.remove() with tombstones
  > **What was done:** Modified `remove()` to use `findCurrentEntryInternal`
  > prefix lookup and apply SI semantics. Cross-transaction removes (different
  > ts) preserve the old value in the snapshot + visibility indexes, remove the
  > old B-tree entry, and insert a tombstone with the new ts (net tree size
  > unchanged). Same-transaction removes (same ts) physically delete the entry
  > (the caller created it in this tx, so no tombstone needed). Already-
  > tombstoned entries return null immediately (double-remove guard). Added
  > defensive assertion that the tombstone key does not exist after
  > `removeEntryByKey`. 9 tests covering cross-tx tombstone creation, snapshot
  > preservation, tree size invariant, same-tx physical delete, tombstone data
  > fidelity, double-remove guard, put-remove-put lifecycle, and post-split
  > removes.
  >
  > **What changed from the plan:** Same-transaction removes physically delete
  > instead of creating a tombstone. The plan called for in-place tombstone
  > replacement, but physical delete is correct for same-ts because the entry
  > was created by this transaction (no other tx can see it). This also
  > maintains backward compatibility with `IsolatedLinkBagBTreeImpl` which
  > currently uses `ts=0L` for all operations — same-ts physical delete
  > preserves the old remove behavior until Step 4 wires in proper timestamps.
  >
  > **Key files:** `SharedLinkBagBTree.java` (modified),
  > `SharedLinkBagBTreeRemoveSITest.java` (new)

- [x] Step 4: IsolatedLinkBagBTreeImpl write path wiring + tombstone filtering
  > **What was done:** Wired `IsolatedLinkBagBTreeImpl` to use real commit
  > timestamps via `atomicOperation.getCommitTs()` in `put()`, `remove()`,
  > and `clear()`. Switched `get()` from exact-match to prefix-based
  > `findCurrentEntry` lookup, returning null for tombstones. Added tombstone
  > filtering to all read-path methods: `getRealBagSize()`, `isEmpty()`,
  > `firstKey()`, `lastKey()`, `loadEntriesMajor()`, and
  > `TransformingSpliterator.tryAdvance()`. Removed Track 1 TODO comments
  > from `BTreeTestIT.java`. All existing tests pass — tombstone filtering
  > ensures backward compatibility.
  >
  > **What changed from the plan:** The step expanded beyond just write path
  > wiring to include tombstone filtering on all read-path methods. This was
  > necessary because switching from `ts=0L` to real `commitTs` activates
  > cross-tx tombstone creation, and existing higher-level tests expect edge
  > counts and iteration to reflect only live edges. Separate integration
  > tests were not needed — the existing graph-level tests (SBTreeBagDeleteTest,
  > DoubleSidedEdgeLinkBagTest, CommandExecutorSQLDeleteEdgeTest) already
  > exercise the full put/remove/clear path through IsolatedLinkBagBTreeImpl
  > and verify correct behavior.
