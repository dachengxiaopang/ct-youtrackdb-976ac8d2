# Consistency Review — optimize-single-value-get

## Iteration 1

### CR1 [should-fix] — ACCEPTED, VERIFIED
Sequence diagram used `checkSnapshotVisibility` instead of `checkVisibility`. Fixed.

### CR2 [should-fix] — ACCEPTED, VERIFIED
`emitSnapshotVisibility()` has consumer-based signature incompatible with
`checkVisibility()` returning RID. Track 1 updated to mention extracting core
snapshot lookup into return-value-based helper.

### CR3 [should-fix] — ACCEPTED, VERIFIED
Null key filtering described as "verify key component count equals keySize" —
incorrect for multi-field indexes. Design updated to match `extractKey()` semantics.

### CR4 [suggestion] — ACCEPTED, VERIFIED
`emitSnapshotVisibility()` described as "private" but is package-private. Fixed.

### CR5 [suggestion] — REJECTED
BTree class location in component map is sufficient as-is.

### CR6 [suggestion] — ACCEPTED, VERIFIED
Design didn't mention `loadPageOptimistic()` for sibling traversal. Added.

### CR7 [suggestion] — ACCEPTED, VERIFIED
Track 1 scope should mention snapshot helper extraction. Merged with CR2 fix.

## Gate Verification: PASS
All accepted findings verified. No new inconsistencies.
