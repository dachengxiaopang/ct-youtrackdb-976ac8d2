# Complexity-Adaptive Workflow Tiering — Design (final)

## Overview

Before this change, every `/create-plan` … `/execute-tracks` run carried the
same ceremony: a mandatory `design.md`, a strategic `implementation-plan.md`,
per-track files, an adversarial review on the design, two Phase-2 plan reviews,
and the full Phase-3A review panel. That weight is right for a
transaction-durability rework and pure overhead for a one-line YQL-function fix.
The fixed cost fell hardest on the small and mid-size changes that make up most
of the work.

This change makes the workflow shed artifacts and review passes by change
complexity. A change is classified into one of three **tiers** (`full`, `lite`,
`minimal`) at the Phase 0 → Phase 1 boundary, and the tier decides which
artifacts are authored and which review passes run.

Two additions make the shedding safe. A **research log** is a single durable
Phase-0/1 decision ledger every tier produces, so the load-bearing decisions are
captured and challenged once, up front, regardless of which later artifacts
survive. A **two-gate classifier** decomposes the tier into orthogonal yes/no
questions (needs a design document, and one track or several), so a high-stakes
but small change is expressible where a flat three-way split would force a bad
fit.

What restructured to fit: the adversarial review moved off `design.md` onto the
research log so the no-design tiers still get it; the cold-read review moved to
artifact write-time with an absorption-completeness criterion; the plan became a
thin aggregator over self-contained track files; decision records became
track-canonical in every tier, with a frozen `design.md` seed in `full`; and the
review gates learned to key off the tier instead of step count. The
`workflow-startup-precheck.sh` resume script was never touched (S1 held): every
tier emits a shape-complete plan it reads, with one tier-aware resume branch added
in `create-plan` Step 1c.

This branch is itself a `full`-tier, workflow-modifying change, so it authored its
own `design.md`, staged every workflow edit under §1.7, and promoted the staged
tree to live at Phase 4 (I6 held for the branch lifetime). The rest of the document
covers Core Concepts, Class Design, Workflow, then seven Parts in the order the
Core Concepts pointers name.

## Core Concepts

This design introduces nine load-bearing ideas. Each is named here and used
without re-definition in the Parts that follow; each entry pairs the new concept
with what it replaces so the delta from the prior workflow is visible at a glance.

**Change tier.** The workflow-ceremony level of a change: `full`, `lite`, or
`minimal`. It drives which artifacts are authored and which reviews run.
Replaces "every change runs the full ceremony." → Part 1 §"Tier classification
model".

**The two orthogonal gates.** The tier is computed from two independent yes/no
questions rather than a single ordinal scale. Gate 1 asks whether the change
needs a `design.md`; Gate 2 asks whether it is multi-track or single-track.
Replaces the first-draft flat "high / mid / low" scale. → Part 1 §"Tier
classification model".

**Research log.** A durable Phase-0/1 decision ledger (`research-log.md`)
holding the initial request, a decision log, surprises, open questions, and a
baseline/re-validation anchor. Every tier produces it; it is consumed by the
later artifacts, not referenced by them. Replaces conversation context that
`/clear` destroyed. → Part 2 §"The research log".

**Aggregator plan.** `implementation-plan.md` is always a thin checklist that
aggregates self-contained track files; in the `minimal` tier it shrinks to a
shape-complete stub. Replaces the plan as a standalone strategic carrier.
→ Part 4 §"Carriers and self-containment".

**Track-canonical live decisions.** Every track carries the full live Decision
Record inline, in every tier, so a cold reader follows the whole argument
without leaving the file and the live decision evolves where execution happens.
In `full`, `design.md` is a frozen seed — provenance and mechanism, never the
live carrier. Replaces the tier-relative carrier split. → Part 4 §"Carriers and
self-containment".

**Relocated adversarial review.** The adversarial pass targets the research log,
not `design.md`, and runs once at the Phase 0 → 1 boundary as a gate. During
Phase-1 authoring the gate re-triggers per appended decision; once an artifact
is presented for user review, findings queue and batch through one gate run, one
mutation, and one cold-read. Replaces the design-only adversarial pass that left
the no-design tiers uncovered. → Part 3 §"Relocated adversarial review".

**Write-time cold-read.** The comprehension review runs while the author still
holds context: on `design.md` in Step 4a and on the plan-at-start track sections
in Step 4b, with an absorption-completeness criterion at both. Replaces
cold-read that only ever saw `design.md`. → Part 5 §"Write-time cold-read and
absorption-completeness".

**Tier-driven review selection.** The tier — not step count — selects which
Phase 2 and Phase 3A passes run. Replaces the Phase-3A step-count complexity
notion as the change-level selector. → Part 6 §"Tier-driven review selection".

**Inline decision records.** Within each artifact a decision is introduced once
in full and referenced thereafter, never restated as a bare citation (inside the
`design.md` seed and inside each track). The seed→track copy crosses artifacts
and is intentional, not a violation of introduce-once. Replaces scattered
out-of-file decision references. → Part 4 §"Carriers and self-containment".

## Class Design

The "classes" here are workflow artifacts and the scripts and prompts that read
and write them. The diagram shows what each tier produces, which component reads
each artifact, and where the relocated reviews attach.

The tier driver lives in `create-plan` Step 4: it reads the now-complete research
log, proposes a tier, and the user confirms it. The research log is the one
artifact every tier produces, which is why the relocated adversarial review
attaches there; its resolved verdicts land in the log's `## Adversarial gate
record` section, the durable verdict carrier the Phase-4 fold reads. `design.md`
exists only in `full`. The plan is always present and always shape-complete so
the `workflow-startup-precheck.sh` resume script keeps working untouched; in
`minimal` it is a stub. The cold-read prompt is reused at two write-time spawn
points; the adversarial prompt gains a third scope targeting the log. The
review-selection logic in `track-review.md` and `implementation-review.md` keys
off the tier. `design-mechanical-checks.py` is the one workflow file outside the
§1.7 stageable prefixes, so its footer-shape edit landed on the live path
mid-branch.

## Workflow

The control flow below shows the Phase 0 → Phase 1 boundary where the tier is
decided and the per-tier branch that follows.

```

The tier is decided once, at the end of Phase 0, before any Phase 1 artifact
exists, so there is no chicken-and-egg between the tier and a track count that
planning has not yet produced. The adversarial gate runs on the log immediately
after tier confirmation, capped at three re-spawns. The `full` tier keeps the
design-first session boundary: Step 4a authors and freezes `design.md`, a fresh
session derives the plan in Step 4b. The `lite` and `minimal` tiers have no
`design.md`, so they collapse Phase 1 into a single Step-4b session. Every tier
ends at the same Step 5 commit and draft PR, and `/execute-tracks` reads the tier
to select its review passes.

# Part 1 — Tier classification

How a change is sorted into `full`, `lite`, or `minimal`, when the decision is
made, who confirms it, and what happens when the estimate turns out wrong
mid-execution.

## Tier classification model

**TL;DR.** The tier is two orthogonal yes/no gates, not one ordinal scale.
Gate 1 asks whether the change needs a `design.md`; Gate 2 asks whether it spans
multiple tracks. The agent proposes the tier from the research log at the
Phase 0 → 1 boundary and the user confirms it. Gate 1's criteria reuse the
HIGH-risk category vocabulary already in `risk-tagging.md`, read at the change
level. A mid-flight balloon escalates the tier through the inline-replan path.

### The two gates and the tier map

The tier factors into two independent questions so that "high-stakes but small"
is expressible — the case a flat `high`/`mid`/`low` scale could not name.

| Gate | Question | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| Gate 1 | Does the change need a `design.md`? | yes / no |
| Gate 2 | Does the change span multiple tracks? | multi / single |

The two gates collapse to three reachable tiers (a design-needing change is
treated as multi-track by construction, since a change worth a design document
is not a single-track stub):

| Tier | Gate 1 | Gate 2 | Artifacts | Phase-4 durable artifacts |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `full` | design = yes | multi | `design.md` + aggregator plan + tracks | `design-final.md` + `adr.md` |
| `lite` | design = no | multi | aggregator plan + tracks, no design | `adr.md` |
| `minimal` | design = no | single | shape-complete stub plan + one self-contained track | PR-description verdict summary; no `docs/adr/` entry |

The tier names `full` / `lite` / `minimal` describe the workflow-ceremony level
and are deliberately distinct from two other complexity vocabularies already in
the workflow: the per-step `risk` tag (`low`/`medium`/`high`) and the Phase-3A
step-count axis (Simple/Moderate/Complex). Keeping all three vocabularies
non-colliding means no two of them can be confused at a glance. The first draft
named the tiers complex/moderate/simple, which collided head-on with the
step-count axis; the rename was forced by the relocated adversarial review of
this branch's own research log (Part 3).

### Gate 1 criteria and change-level aggregation

Gate 1's "needs a design" test sources from the HIGH-risk category list already
maintained in `risk-tagging.md` (concurrency, crash-safety/durability, public
API, security, architecture/cross-component, performance hot path, and workflow
machinery), read at the **change** level rather than the per-step level. The
question is whether one of these categories is central to the change, which
shares one source of truth with the Phase-A per-step tagging that the same list
drives.

Change-level reading is not "contains one high-risk step." A mostly-mechanical
change with a single risky line does not become `full`. The aggregation rule:
Gate 1 is yes when a HIGH-risk category is **central to the change's purpose**,
not merely touched by one incidental edit. This is a judgment the agent makes
from the research log and the user ratifies; the gate records which categories
matched, because those same categories prime the relocated adversarial review.
The matched set is the **centrally-matched** categories only: emphasis lenses
derive from them plus explicit user additions at tier confirmation, so a
Gate-1-no change runs its gate lens-free unless the user adds one — a
touched-but-not-central category does not generate a lens.

### Timing, proposal, and confirmation

The decision sits at the Phase 0 → 1 boundary (`create-plan` Step 4), reading the
now-rich research log. The agent proposes the tier and the matched risk
categories; the user confirms or overrides in either direction. This keeps a
human gate on the artifact-shedding decision without forcing the user to declare
a tier before the agent's scope assessment exists. The tier is decided once,
before any Phase 1 artifact is written, so it has a clean home and no circular
dependency on a not-yet-derived track count. The confirmed tier persists as a
one-line `tier:` entry in `implementation-plan.md` directly under the title, the
one change-level line every `/execute-tracks` session reads at startup.

### Mid-flight tier upgrade

The estimate can be wrong: a `minimal` single track balloons during Phase A/B, or
a `lite` change turns out to need a design. The tier upgrade rides the existing
inline-replan ESCALATE path rather than a new mechanism. The honest framing is
that the Phase 0 → 1 decision "decides at the cleanest available point on the best
estimate," not that it "resolves the circularity"; Gate 2 remains an estimate
until decomposition. An upgrade adds the new tier's artifacts and runs its
Phase-3A passes from the upgrade point onward: a `lite` upgrade gains a
`design.md` if Gate 1 also flips, and the narrowed adversarial pass begins running
on subsequent tracks. It does not reach back to re-run a Phase-2 pass an earlier
session already skipped. The reviews-cannot-be-un-run asymmetry reads both ways: a
downgrade cannot un-run a completed review, and an upgrade cannot retroactively
insert one the workflow has already moved past, so a downgrade is likewise not
automatic.

An upgrade writes the new tier into the plan's `tier:` line as its first landed
artifact, because the re-entered Phase-2/3A selectors read that line to pick
their passes; an upgrade that changed the artifacts but not the line would leave
a re-entered selector reading the stale pre-upgrade tier. This inline-replan
rewrite is the one execution-time exception to the rule that only `create-plan`
writes the tier line.

### Edge cases / Gotchas

- A `minimal` change that grows a second track mid-execution is a Gate-2 miss,
  not a Gate-1 miss: it becomes `lite`, and only gains a `design.md` if a
  HIGH-risk category also turns out central.
- Confirming the tier also confirms the matched risk categories, so the user
  changing the tier at confirmation time may shift the adversarial lenses; the
  user may add or drop a lens explicitly at that point.
- "Workflow machinery" is itself a HIGH-risk category, so a change to this very
  workflow is `full` and authors its own `design.md` — this branch included.

# Part 2 — The research log

The single durable decision ledger every tier produces, its structure, its
lifetime, and the strict rule on who may read it for what.

## The research log

**TL;DR.** D5 makes the research log the one artifact present in all three tiers.
It anchors the initial user request and logs decisions, surprises, and open
questions across `/clear` and the Phase 0 → 1 boundary, plus a fifth
baseline/re-validation section for workflow-modifying branches, and a sixth
`## Adversarial gate record` section that carries the relocated review's resolved
verdicts. It is consumed by the later artifacts, never referenced by them, and is
removed at the Phase 4 cleanup. After a track absorbs a decision, the track is
authoritative; the log (and, in `full`, the `design.md` seed record) is
historical provenance.

### Structure and lifetime

The log carries five authored sections plus one gate-record section.
`## Initial request` is the verbatim aim, written once so a session boundary
never re-asks it; `## Decision Log`, `## Surprises & Discoveries`, and
`## Open Questions` are append-only continuous logs with ISO timestamps and a
context-level tag; `## Baseline and re-validation` is the rebase-drift anchor a
workflow-modifying branch needs. The `## Adversarial gate record` section is the
durable verdict carrier the relocated review appends to (Part 3): the
implementation defined its shape once in `research.md` (a dated
`### Adversarial review of this log (<ISO>) — <PASS | NEEDS REVISION[: counts]>`
heading, latest dated entry matched on loop, with a stated cadence) and pointed
every producer and consumer at that one canonical home.

The log's lifetime is wider than a Phase-0-only scratch pad. In the `full` tier,
load-bearing decisions surfaced during Step 4a design authoring are appended to
the Decision Log and re-trigger the adversarial gate on the new entry. The
re-trigger is immediate during pre-presentation authoring; once the design is
presented for user review, decisions queue for the batch gate instead (D15,
Part 3). The log is thus the single Phase-0/1 decision ledger. The "consumed, not
referenced" story still holds: the later artifacts read the log to seed
themselves but never cross-link to it; only the append window widens to cover
Phase 1 design authoring.

### Read-scope discipline

S2 makes the log → carrier seed strictly one-way. The log is read for **decision
content** in exactly two places: at Step 4a/4b artifact authoring (to seed the
carriers) and by the Phase-2 consistency review (as a cross-check). The
write-time cold-reads' absorption cross-check (Part 5) reads the log inside these
same authoring steps, so it is not a third read point. One further read is
sanctioned and is verdict-only, not decision content: the Phase-4 fold reads the
log's resolved `## Adversarial gate record` entries to write the durable audit
trail (Part 7). Step 4b seeds decision records from the **carrier's** inline
records, not from the log — in `full`, from the frozen `design.md` seed's
D-records; in `lite`/`minimal`, Step-4b authoring is itself the log's decision-read
point. Once a track has absorbed a decision as an inline record, the track is the
authority and the log is historical; a design-side seed record confers
provenance, never authority (D7). This is what prevents a dual source of truth
once the same decision exists in the log, the seed, and the track.

### Edge cases / Gotchas

- The log is removed in the Phase 4 cleanup commit with the rest of `_workflow/`,
  so any audit trail that must survive merge is folded into a durable carrier,
  not left in the log: `adr.md` in `full`/`lite`, the two-line PR-description
  verdict summary in `minimal` (Part 7, D16). `minimal`'s full trail otherwise
  survives only in the PR's commit history on GitHub.
- A decision appended during pre-presentation Step-4a authoring re-opens the
  adversarial gate on that entry only, not the whole log; the gate's
  loop-on-blockers semantics apply to the new entry. Once the design is presented
  for user review, decisions queue for the batch gate instead (D15, Part 3).
- Reading the log as a Step-4b decision-seeding input is the failure S2 forbids:
  it would let an unabsorbed log decision pass every gate while the carrier
  silently fails self-containment.

### References

- D-records: D5 (research log as single Phase-0/1 ledger; fifth section; widened
  lifetime; the `## Adversarial gate record` verdict carrier), D15 (hold-window
  decisions queue for the batch gate instead of D5's immediate re-trigger —
  Part 3), D16 (audit-trail carrier per tier: `adr.md` fold in `full`/`lite`,
  PR-description summary in `minimal` — Part 7)
- Invariants: S2 (one-way log → carrier seed; two decision-content reads plus the
  sanctioned verdict-only Phase-4 fold; track authoritative after absorption)

# Part 3 — Relocated adversarial review

Moving the adversarial pass off `design.md` and onto the research log so every
tier gets it, with domain priming and gate semantics, and the ordering rule that
keeps the design freeze intact.

## Relocated adversarial review

**TL;DR.** D6 moves the adversarial review's target from `design.md` to
`research-log.md` and runs it once at the Phase 0 → 1 boundary as a gate: loop on
blockers, gate on should-fix, no `skip`, capped at `iteration_budget=3`. It
reuses `prompts/adversarial-review.md` with a third scoped section and is
domain-primed off the confirmed tier's matched risk categories. `edit-design`'s
`phase1-creation` drops its own Step 3.5 adversarial pass, so `design.md` then
gets cold-read only — gated behind the log-adversarial gate clearing so the
design-first freeze order is preserved. D14 model-triages every adversarial spawn
by tier: Fable 5 in `full`, Opus 4.x in `lite`/`minimal`. D15 batches review-hold
findings: queued during the user's review of a frozen-ready artifact, validated
in one gate run, applied in one mutation. D17 makes every third-scope spawn
persist a review file and return a thin manifest, so gate iterations do not
accumulate certificates in the orchestrator's context.

### Why the log, and what it gains

The adversarial pass challenges decisions and hidden assumptions, which is exactly
what the research log captures explicitly: each Decision Log entry's `Why` and
`Alternatives rejected` map onto the challenge certificate's `Chosen approach` /
`Best rejected alternative` / `Counterargument trace`. Attaching the pass to the
log makes it universal across tiers: the log is the only artifact present in all
three, so `lite` and `minimal` gain adversarial coverage they would otherwise
lose entirely when `design.md` disappears. It also shifts the challenge left: a
flawed decision is caught before any design or track derives from it. This branch
dogfooded the relocation against its own research log; that review reshaped the
design materially before any track derived (Part 3 §"What the dogfood review
caught").

### Reuse and the third scope

D6 reuses the existing adversarial reviewer rather than adding a new one.
`prompts/adversarial-review.md` already demonstrates retargeting — its
`## Design-scoped review (Phase 1)` section retargets the Phase-3A track machinery
onto `design.md`. A third section, `## Research-log-scoped review (Phase 0→1)`,
follows the same pattern: target the Decision Log, Surprises, and Open Questions;
raise DECISION challenges on the Decision Log and ASSUMPTION/INVARIANT challenges
on Surprises; treat scope/simplification challenges as mostly not-applicable
before decomposition; and map the outcome to blocker-loops (re-decide in
research), should-fix gates, and no `skip` (a would-be `skip` is raised to a
blocker). The code-grounding and the workflow-modifying criteria block transfer
unchanged.

D17 fixes the third scope's output mode to **file**: every third-scope spawn (the
Phase 0→1 gate and the D15 batch-gate runs alike) supplies an output path; the
reviewer persists the `conventions-execution.md` §2.5 manifest-plus-sections
review file under `_workflow/reviews/` with `<type>-iter<N>.md` naming, and
returns only the thin manifest, and the orchestrator partial-fetches `## Findings`
from disk. The gate loops on blockers by design, so an inline return would park
every iteration's full certificate set in the orchestrator's context for the rest
of the session; the file return caps that cost and makes a mid-gate `/clear`
resumable from disk. The log's `## Adversarial gate record` entries remain the
verdict carrier the Phase-4 consumers read: the `adr.md` fold in `full`/`lite`,
the PR-description summary in `minimal` (Part 7, D16). The per-iteration review
files die in the Phase 4 cleanup without feeding either.

The wiring needed §2.5 to be reachable at Phase 0→1 on both annotation axes: its
TOC row and the section markers of the subsections the third scope uses extended
their phases with `1` and their roles with `planner`, because `create-plan` runs
as `planner` and the gate writer runs at phase `1`. An explicit read-instruction
alone is non-viable under the TOC role/phase filter. The implementation resolved
the open iteration-≥2 question to §2.5's verdict-producer manifest variant and
extended that row on the same two axes.

### Domain priming

D6 primes the single research-log reviewer with the tier's matched risk categories
as emphasis lenses rather than spawning separate dimensional agents. The lens set
is the centrally-matched categories plus explicit user additions at tier
confirmation (D16); a Gate-1-no change therefore runs lens-free unless the user
adds one. Confirming the tier confirms the categories, which generate the lenses
automatically — concurrency maps to a bugs-concurrency lens, crash-safety and
durability to a crash-safety lens, performance hot path to a performance lens,
security to a security lens, and workflow machinery to prose-scrutiny emphases
(rule coherence, instruction completeness, context budget) applied to the log's
decisions. The workflow-machinery emphasis names scrutiny stances the one
adversarial reviewer adopts, not the `review-workflow-*` agents: those are
`/code-review`-dispatched diff reviewers whose subject, a written `.profile-b/**`
diff, does not exist at the Phase 0 → 1 boundary. Public-API and architecture
categories add no dedicated lens because the adversarial and design passes already
cover them. Priming is deliberately lighter than a full specialist review;
specialist depth lands later at Phase 3B/3C on real code. The user may add or drop
a lens at tier confirmation.

### Reviewer model triage

D14 keys the adversarial reviewer's model off the confirmed tier: `full` spawns
Fable 5, `lite`/`minimal` spawn Opus 4.x. The rule covers every
adversarial-reviewer spawn: this gate and the narrowed Phase-3A track adversarial
(Part 6); `minimal` drops the 3A pass, so its 3A branch is moot. The technical and
risk reviewers and the cold-read stay at the session default: they are
checkable-surface reviews whose value is coverage, while the adversarial pass's
value is maximum-depth challenge.

The tier encodes the stakes (Gate 1 = a HIGH-risk category central to the change),
so the highest-stakes ledgers get the strongest model and the cheap tiers keep a
frontier model. Stakes dominate coverage in the allocation: a `lite`/`minimal`
miss is, by Gate-1 construction, not centrally high-risk and still meets Phase
3B/3C and code review downstream. The accepted price: Fable 5 costs roughly twice
Opus 4.x per token, multiplied by the gate's loop-on-blockers iterations; it is
charged only to `full`-tier changes.

The implementation landed the model half on the Agent tool's `model` field, which
both the gate spawn and the Phase-3A spawn set per tier. The design anticipated a
paired xhigh-effort pin; the harness exposes no per-spawn effort field and no
adversarial-reviewer agent file exists under `.profile-b/agents/` (the reviewers are
prompt-file plus `general-purpose` spawns), so the effort half has no surface to
ride and degrades to the session default. This is the degradation order D14
recorded up front: the model split lands, the effort pin falls back to inheritance,
and neither outcome reopens the decision.

### Freeze-order preservation

S3 keeps `edit-design`'s adversarial → cold-read → freeze order intact even though
the adversarial pass no longer lives inside `edit-design`. The design's cold-read
is gated behind the log-adversarial gate clearing: a `design.md` draft cannot
reach cold-read while a log-adversarial entry is open. So a load-bearing decision
surfaced during pre-presentation design authoring (Part 2) is appended to the log,
re-challenged, and cleared before the cold-read assesses comprehension — the same
ordering the in-`edit-design` Step 3.5 used to give. The gate's state lives in the
log's `## Adversarial gate record`: the cold-read reads the latest dated entry and
blocks while it carries an open blocker or should-fix. Decisions surfaced after
the design is presented for user review batch through the same gate at
review-iteration end (D15, below), which preserves the ordering: the batch gate
clears before the batch's cold-read runs.

### Review-iteration batching

D15 batches the user-review loop. When a frozen-ready Phase-1 artifact is presented
for review (`design.md` after the Step-4a review passes; the plan and tracks at
Step 4b's pre-persist confirmation), findings raised during the review collect into
a tagged queue (`[clarification]` = wording, no decision content; `[decision]` =
new or changed decision) and process as one batch when the user declares the
review done, never one by one. The window opens at the presentation the user
reviews from: a presentation with a PASS outcome, or the user's acceptance of open
risks on a presentation with residual findings. D5's per-entry immediate gate
re-trigger governs only pre-presentation authoring; every decision surfaced after
the boundary joins the queue, user-raised or agent-surfaced. A multi-session hold
carries the queue in the mid-phase handoff.

The batch runs in three steps. First, all `[decision]` items append to the
Decision Log together and one gate run validates them; each loop iteration
re-challenges every entry in the batch, since a fix to one entry can invalidate a
sibling's PASS, capped at `iteration_budget=3`. Second, the cleared decisions and
the `[clarification]` items apply in one mutation; a decision-shaped finding
surfaced inside the mutation exits to the log before any fix attempt, never
auto-fixed in place. Third, one cold-read covers all changes, with loop-back: a
decision-shaped cold-read finding re-enters the gate step, and the batch cannot
close, nor the artifact re-present, while a log entry is open. A budget-exhausted
mutation escalates to the user as a failure, not as a re-presentation. S3 holds
across the whole loop.

The queue is the default, not a hard gate: the user may ask for immediate
processing of a single blocking finding, which runs the single-decision route at
its full cost and ends with a note of what moved, in chat and in the handoff's
queue block when the hold spans sessions. The gains: the gate challenges
interacting findings together, one gate spawn plus one mutation plus one cold-read
amortize across the batch (dividing the D14 premium by batch size), and the
artifact never moves mid-review unless the user waives it. The accepted trades: a
held batch applies at cold context in the flush session, which counts as the "same
session" for Part 5's blocker loop, and a batch of one degenerates to the
single-finding route.

### What the dogfood review caught

This branch's research log was the first ledger the relocated review ran against,
so the review reshaped the design that defines it. The first pass returned two
blockers and several should-fix findings, and forced the load-bearing structure
the rest of this document rests on: the shape-complete stub plan and the
tier-aware Step 1c resume branch (the "content-free stub / state machine never
touched" claim was false); the S3 freeze-order ordering rule and the Phase-4 fold
that keeps the adversarial trail alive past the log's deletion; the
full/lite/minimal rename away from a name set that collided with the step-count
axis; and the move of cold-read to write-time (Step 4b) rather than folding it
into Phase 2. The gate reached PASS after iterating those findings to resolution.
The design is, in a precise sense, the output of the mechanism it specifies.

### Edge cases / Gotchas

- `phase4-creation` already has no adversarial pass, so Phase 4 is unaffected by
  the relocation.
- Running the adversarial pass on both the log and `design.md` was rejected as
  double cost: the log is the decision source, so a second pass on the design
  prose is redundant.
- For `lite`/`minimal`, the log-adversarial gate is the only adversarial coverage
  the change receives before code review; this is intended, since those tiers shed
  the design entirely.
- A gate re-trigger during Step 4a (a load-bearing decision appended while
  authoring the design) spawns with the already-confirmed tier — `full` by
  construction, since Step 4a only exists in `full`.

# Part 4 — Carriers and self-containment

Where the live decision lives (the tracks, in every tier), what the frozen
`design.md` seed keeps in `full`, the always-present aggregator plan and its
`minimal`-tier stub, and how the inline-record mechanism is reconciled with the
durable log.

## Carriers and self-containment

**TL;DR.** D7 makes the tracks the live decision carrier in every tier: each track
carries the full inline DR, and a cross-track propagation duty keeps duplicated
records one logical decision through replans. In `full`, `design.md` is a frozen
seed — it keeps its D-records and mechanism for Step-4b derivation, review-phase
navigation, and on-demand reference, but never carries the live decision. D1 keeps
the plan an aggregator in every tier, shrunk to a shape-complete stub in `minimal`.
D11 adopts the inline-record mechanism within the seed while overriding its
log-as-transient framing, and scopes the footer rename and its mechanical check to
`design.md`.

### The aggregator plan and the minimal stub

D1 keeps `implementation-plan.md` present in every tier so the resume state
machine, the drift gate, and Phase-2 routing all keep working unchanged — the
machinery reads the plan to derive every post-Phase-0 state. Two routes were
weighed: keep a near-empty auto-generated aggregator plan, or rewire the state
machine to derive state from track presence when the plan is absent. The first
wins; the second would destabilize the resume engine. The plan is already a thin
checklist, so the stub is roughly ten lines.

The `minimal` stub is sharpened from "content-free" to "minimal but
shape-complete." S1 requires the stub to carry exactly what the machinery reads:
a `## Plan Review` section with its decision checkbox, a glyph-valid `## Checklist`
with one track entry, a `## Final Artifacts` section with its decision checkbox,
and the D18 `tier:` line. The script reads each section's first top-level
checkbox, so bare headings would strand the resume machine in State 0; the stub
template specifies the checkbox-bearing shape, and a live fixture under
`.profile-b/scripts/tests/` proves the unchanged precheck parses it across the State
0 / A / C / D / Done transitions. `create-plan` Step 1c also gains a tier-aware
branch that distinguishes "`lite`/`minimal` in progress, no `design.md` by design"
from "fresh start," keyed on `implementation-plan.md` presence and its `tier:`
line rather than any new log read, so a no-design tier interrupted mid-planning
does not route back to Step 4a design authoring on resume. S1 names this boundary
precisely: the `workflow-startup-precheck.sh` script is never edited, and the lone
resume-routing change is the Step 1c branch — the bash state machine reads the
shape-complete plan unchanged in every tier.

One block flows up into the aggregator in every tier: the per-track completion
episode. At Phase C, after user approval, the orchestrator writes the
`**Track episode:**` block into the plan's `## Checklist` entry for the completed
track — the `minimal` stub included; it is the one content block the stub
accumulates. The track episode is distinct from per-step episodes, which live in
the track file's `## Episodes` section, and from decision records, which are
track-canonical (D7) and never aggregate upward.

### Track-canonical live decisions

D7 makes the track files the live decision carrier in every tier. A frozen
artifact cannot be canonical for something that evolves: tracks change through
Phase 3 (inline replan, scope-downs, decision-log appends) while `design.md`
freezes at Step 4a, and the implementer's frozen-design guard names the live DR
authoritative during execution. So every track carries the full inline DR, no
out-of-file references, in every tier:

| Tier | Live decision carrier | Track DR shape | Frozen seed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `full` | the track files | full inline DR | `design.md` keeps D-records + mechanism |
| `lite` | the track files | full inline DR | — |
| `minimal` | the one track file | full inline DR | — |

In `full`, `design.md` survives as the frozen seed with three roles: the source
Step 4b derives the plan and tracks from, the review-phase navigation surface
(research-log ↔ `design.md` D-records ↔ track DRs), and the on-demand
`**Full design**` mechanism reference. The pointer semantics flip with it: a
`**Full design**` line in a track DR says "frozen mechanism and seed rationale live
here," never "the canonical decision lives here" — the decision is fully in the
track. The seed→track copy is one-directional by construction (the seed is frozen
and cannot drift toward the track), and the fidelity criterion (Part 5) checks the
copy at authoring time.

Phase-3 consumption follows the carrier: implementer and reviewer sub-agents
receive the slim plan plus the slim track with its full DRs inline; `design.md`
stays path-only, on-demand context. The flip buys coherence, not context savings —
full-tier track files grow by their duplicated DRs (10 to 30 lines each), an
accepted price bounded by the four-bullet DR discipline retargeted to track DRs and
by the slim-track rendering. The implemented slim-track rendering is a doc-only
orchestrator-prose rule in `plan-slim-rendering.md`; it renders the slim track
inline before passing it to sub-agents and needs no `render-slim-plan.py` change,
so S1 holds. Wiring the existing Phase-3A/3B spawn prompts to consume the new
rendering (they pass the full on-disk track file today) is a recorded follow-up,
flagged in the doc so a reviewer does not read the rendering as already in effect.
The frozen-design guard holds as written, with its "plan's DRs" wording re-worded
to "track's DRs."

### Cross-track propagation

A decision duplicated across tracks stays one logical live record. When an inline
replan revises a decision whose full DR is duplicated in several track files, the
orchestrator updates the copy in every relevant not-yet-completed track file in the
same replan, and appends a supersession note, naming the superseded DR, to the
`## Decision Log` of any completed track that carried it. The copy-shape rule is
decision-state-based, not replan-event-based: any post-seed copy of a decision that
has ever been revised is written in the inline-replan revision format (the seed
decision stays in its `**Original decision**` field), never as clean revised text,
so every post-seed copy carries the marker that routes it to the fidelity check's
provenance-only path (Part 5). Two reconciliations ride the Phase-3 ripple: the
replan rules' updatable-section lists for not-yet-started and mid-execution tracks
gain `## Decision Log` so the duty's primary write path is open without an ESCALATE
pause, and the completed-track pause gains a carve-out for the documentation-only
supersession-note append. The same `## Decision Log` addition is mirrored in the
`conventions-execution.md` §2.1 mid-execution-rewrite line, so the two enumerations
that govern the write path stay consistent and must move together if either is
edited later.

### Inline-record reconciliation

D11 adopts the inline decision-record mechanism (records per complex-topic
section, introduce-once-reference-thereafter, the per-section footer rename from
`References` to `Decisions & invariants`, and a "decision cited without rationale or
cross-reference" mechanical check) as the design-side analog of the track-side
inline DRs. Both express one principle: introduce a decision once in full within
each artifact and reference it thereafter, while the tracks carry the live record
(D7), seeded from the `design.md` seed in `full` and directly from the log in
`lite`/`minimal` (S2).

D11 overrides the source proposal's log-as-transient-bridge framing where it
conflicts with D5: the log is a durable Phase-0/1 ledger read during Step 4a/4b and
removed at Phase 4 cleanup, not a bridge folded into the design and deleted before
freeze. The seeding boundary is rewritten accordingly: Step 4b seeds from the
frozen `design.md` seed's D-records in `full` (in `lite`/`minimal`, Step-4b
authoring is itself the log's read point), and the durable log is a Phase-2
consistency cross-check, never a Step-4b decision-seeding input.

D11 splits the two bundled mechanisms by artifact home. The inline-record
**content** adopts for tracks via the existing `## Decision Log` slot, which is the
canonical inline-record home in every tier (track files have no `### References`
footer). The footer rename and the footer-presence mechanical check are scoped to
`design.md` only. The tracks' self-containment guarantee therefore comes from the
cold-read absorption and fidelity criteria (Part 5), not from the mechanical check.

The mechanical-check edit landed on the live `design-mechanical-checks.py`, the one
workflow file outside the §1.7 stageable prefixes. Footer detection now accepts both
the legacy `### References` / `**References.**` spelling and the renamed
`### Decisions & invariants` / `**Decisions & invariants.**` through one shared
footer regex, so the toggle sites cannot drift. A new check flags a D-code cited
bare under the footer with no inline rationale and no full record introduced
anywhere in the doc; a code carrying inline rationale, or whose full record exists
elsewhere, passes regardless of spelling. The frozen `design.md` carries rationale
inline in per-code footer parentheticals rather than `**Dn.**` full-record markup,
and the check recognizes that satisfaction path, so the legacy doc keeps passing. A
parenthetical-depth gate prevents a D-code nested inside another record's
parenthetical from surfacing as a bare citation. The edit shipped with its own
test and fixtures; no existing test was modified, and S1 held.

### Edge cases / Gotchas

- A cross-track decision appears as a full record in each relevant track's
  `## Decision Log` in every tier; in `full` it additionally has its seed D-record
  in `design.md`. The propagation duty keeps the track copies one logical record
  through replans.
- The footer rename does not apply to track files, which have no `### References`
  footer; applying it there is the mistake the by-tier split avoids.
- The `minimal` stub plan is the one carrier that intentionally holds no decision
  content — its single track is canonical for the whole change.

### References

  engine untouched; track-episode aggregation), D7 (track-canonical live decisions

# Part 5 — Write-time cold-read and absorption-completeness

Moving the comprehension review to artifact write-time, adding a second spawn point
in Step 4b, and the absorption-completeness criterion that makes "carrier
authoritative" enforceable.

## Write-time cold-read and absorption-completeness

**TL;DR.** D8 runs the cold-read at artifact write-time, while the author still
holds context: on `design.md` in Step 4a and on the plan-at-start track sections in
Step 4b. The Step-4b cold-read is a new spawn point that reuses the existing
cold-read sub-agent, not a new reviewer. Both cold-reads carry an
absorption-completeness criterion — every load-bearing research-log decision in a
track's scope must appear in the appropriate carrier — and, in `full`, a fidelity
criterion: the track copy must be substantively equivalent to its `design.md` seed
record at authoring time. Authoring-time misses rely on this semantic check with no
mechanical backstop, an accepted residual risk.

### The two write-time spawn points

D8 re-activates the write-time intent (the proposal to extend cold-read to the
plan-at-start sections), which the design-first split had made moot when
`design.md` became mandatory and its cold-read covered the load-bearing argument.
Removing `design.md` for `lite`/`minimal` re-activates that exact motivation: the
plan-at-start sections (track Purpose / Context / Plan of Work / Interfaces and the
root per-track BLUF/triad) need a comprehension audit.

The cold-read is a new spawn point in Step 4b that reuses the existing cold-read
sub-agent — write-time cold-read applied to a second artifact, not a second
reviewer. The structure is tier-dependent:

| Tier | Step 4a cold-read | Step 4b cold-read |
|---|---|---|
| `full` | `design.md` (in the 4a session) | plan/tracks (in the fresh 4b session) |
| `lite` | — (no design) | plan/tracks (single Phase-1 session) |
| `minimal` | — (no design) | stub plan + one track (single Phase-1 session) |

The Step-4b spawn point sits after the track-file write and before the Step 5
commit; the written plan and tracks are then presented for the user's pre-persist
confirmation, which is the presentation D15's review window opens at (Part 3). The
iterate-loop semantics mirror `edit-design`: a blocker re-opens Step-4b derivation
in the same session, capped at the same `iteration_budget`. For a held review
batch, the flush session counts as the same session for this loop (D15, Part 3).

### Absorption-completeness

D8 makes "carrier authoritative" (S2) enforceable by adding an
absorption-completeness criterion to both cold-reads rather than a standalone
mechanism. The cold-reader reviews the records in their plan-at-start state and
cross-checks both ways: every load-bearing research-log decision must appear as an
inline record in the appropriate carrier, and a log decision with no carrier home
is a finding.

The criterion narrows the trigger-set to a checkable surface rather than leaving it
to free judgment:

- **Load-bearing** = a research-log Decision Log entry whose `**Alternatives
  rejected:**` field names a real fork. The field's presence is the mechanical
  surface; the cold-reader still judges whether the named alternative is a real
  fork rather than a vacuous "none," and a genuine fork recorded under a different
  sub-field (a `**Scope note:**` or `**Reconciliation:**`) is still in scope, so
  field placement cannot game the trigger.
- **In-scope** = the decision constrains a file or interface the track touches,
  bound to the track's `## Interfaces and Dependencies`. On a workflow-modifying
  plan, "a file or interface the track touches" includes the workflow-prose files
  and `§`-anchors listed there, so the trigger binds to prose dependencies, not
  only Java symbols.
- **Per-carrier** is uniform for the live record: a full record in each relevant
  track's `## Decision Log`, in every tier. In `full`, the criterion additionally
  requires the decision's seed D-record in `design.md` and fidelity between the two
  (below).

The criterion applies at both write-time cold-reads: Step 4a checks log →
`design.md` D-records, Step 4b checks log → carrier inline records, so every
carrier that may read the log meets the same self-containment bar.

### Fidelity and the post-replan rule

Fidelity is an authoring-time bar, not a standing equality constraint. At the
Step-4b cold-read, each `full`-tier track DR must be substantively equivalent to the
`design.md` seed record it was copied from; a paraphrase that shifts the meaning is
a finding even though the presence check passes. After authoring, the bar inverts in
scope: post-replan divergence between a track copy and the seed is legitimate — the
track evolved and the frozen seed cannot.

The check's domain keeps it safe to re-run: it iterates the `design.md` seed records
and verifies their track copies; a track DR with no seed counterpart is a post-seed
live decision, out of scope by construction. A track DR carrying the inline-replan
revision format, or named by a supersession note, is compared provenance-only — its
`**Original decision**` field, which stays seed-pinned across repeated revisions,
must semantically correspond to the seed (summary-correspondence, not verbatim
inclusion). Seed→track restoration is an authoring-time-only fix; no reviewer or
mechanical pass rewrites a track DR from the seed after authoring.

### Residual risk

D8 accepts that authoring-time absorption and fidelity rely on the semantic
cold-read alone, with no mechanical backstop — the footer-presence check is
`design.md`-only (Part 4). A missed absorption at authoring has no automated catch
in any tier. The residual narrows to authoring time: post-authoring divergence
between duplicated track copies has a defined owner and mechanism (the cross-track
propagation duty, Part 4). This is accepted and stated explicitly: it is consistent
with the cheaper-tier-lighter-guarantee philosophy, and the load-bearing/in-scope
definitions above make the cold-read checkable enough to carry the weight.

### Edge cases / Gotchas

- A research-log decision with an empty `Alternatives rejected` field is not
  load-bearing and does not trigger the absorption check, so a routine note does
  not force a carrier record.
- In `full`, a track DR that paraphrases its seed record into a different meaning
  passes the presence check but fails fidelity — substantive equivalence is the
  bar, not verbatim match. An optional `**Full design**` line in a track DR
  references the seed's mechanism; it never substitutes for the full inline record.
- The Step-4b cold-read blocker re-opens derivation in the same session; it does
  not defer to a later phase, because the author's context is the thing being
  spent. For a held review batch the flush session is that session — the
  cold-context flush is the trade D15 accepts (Part 3).

  blocker loop — Part 3)

# Part 6 — Tier-driven review selection

How the tier, not step count, selects the Phase 2 and Phase 3A passes, which passes
each tier sheds, and how the tier reconciles with the existing per-step risk tag and
step-count axis.

## Tier-driven review selection

**TL;DR.** D9 makes the tier drive review selection at the change level, replacing
the Phase-3A step-count complexity notion as the selector. `minimal` drops the
Phase-2 structural review and the Phase-3A adversarial pass; `lite`/`full` keep the
Phase-3A adversarial pass but narrow it and skip it on the first track. Phase 3B
(`risk:high`-gated) and Phase 3C (triage-gated) run unchanged in every tier. S4
keeps the per-step `risk` tag as the 3B/3C gate so the tier and the risk tag never
stack.

### Per-tier review matrix

D9 keys each Phase-2 and Phase-3A pass off the confirmed tier. Each pass either runs
as today, narrows, or drops:

| Pass | `full` | `lite` | `minimal` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 2 consistency | full (design + plan + tracks) | plan + tracks | track-vs-code only |
| Phase 2 structural | runs | runs | dropped (stub has nothing to check) |
| Phase 3A technical | runs | runs | runs |
| Phase 3A risk | track-characteristic-gated | track-characteristic-gated | dropped |
| Phase 3A adversarial | runs, narrowed (track 1: episode challenge dropped) | runs, narrowed (track 1: episode challenge dropped) | dropped |
| Phase 3B dimensional | `risk:high` steps | `risk:high` steps | `risk:high` steps |
| Phase 3C track code review | triage-gated | triage-gated | triage-gated |

The live Phase-3A pre-execution panel is Technical plus Risk plus Adversarial,
selected before this change by a step-count complexity axis (Simple / Moderate /
Complex). D9's reconciliation replaces that step-count axis with the tier as the
change-level selector, and the section that named it was renamed from "Complexity
Assessment" to "Tier-driven review selection." Technical always runs. The Phase-3A
Risk review stays gated by track characteristics in `lite`/`full`, and the
implemented gate widens the live trigger: critical paths, performance constraints,
**or major architectural decisions** add the Risk pass, rather than the live mapping
that routed architectural decisions to the Adversarial pass alone. It is a distinct
sub-agent from the per-step `risk` tag that gates Phase 3B. The `minimal` tier runs
Technical only, the analog of the live "Simple track → Technical only" floor that
drops both Risk and Adversarial.

The `minimal` tier drops the Phase-2 structural review because a stub plan has one
checklist entry, no decision records, and no ordering, so there is nothing for a
structural pass to check, and its Phase-2 consistency lightens to track-vs-code
since the stub plan has no content to cross-check. The Phase-3A adversarial pass is
dropped for `minimal` because a single track is the whole change the log already
vetted, with no cross-track episodes (the realized outputs earlier tracks hand to
later ones) to challenge.

### The narrowed Phase-3A adversarial pass

For `lite`/`full`, D9 treats a track's inline decisions as already log-vetted, so the
Phase-3A adversarial pass focuses on track realization: scope and sizing,
cross-track-episode reality, and invariant-violation scenarios, rather than
re-challenging the decisions the log gate already cleared. Of those three, only
cross-track-episode reality needs a prior episode, so it is the one challenge
dropped on the first track. Scope/sizing and invariant-violation still run on
track 1, because the foundational track's sizing and invariants most constrain
everything downstream — the track whose realization is most worth challenging is the
one a whole-pass skip would have exempted. The pass's model follows the D14 triage
(Part 3): Fable 5 in `full`, Opus 4.x in `lite`, on the Agent `model` field.

### Reconciliation with the existing complexity inputs

S4 prevents two complexity inputs from stacking. Before this change, Phase 3A
selected its panel by step count and Phase 3B/3C gated on the per-step `risk` tag.
D9's reconciliation: the `tier` replaces the step-count complexity notion at
Phase 3A as the change-level selector, and the per-step `risk` tag stays as the
3B/3C gate. The implementation excised the live Complex-row "or critical path /
high-risk" clause from the panel selector so no per-step risk signal leaks into
panel selection. The tier is the change-level driver; the risk tag is the per-step
driver; they address different scopes and never combine into a single inflated
signal. Phase 3B and 3C are unchanged because they review actual code and diff,
which the pre-code log adversarial does not duplicate.

### Edge cases / Gotchas

- Phase 4's design-final cold-read is absent for `lite`/`minimal` because there is
  no design to carry to a final artifact (Part 7).
- On track 1 of a multi-track `full`/`lite` plan, only the cross-track-episode
  challenge is dropped; the scope/sizing and invariant-violation challenges still
  run, since the foundational track most constrains the downstream ones.
- Removing the Phase-3A adversarial pass entirely was rejected: it would lose the
  track-realization challenges that multi-track `lite`/`full` plans still need.

# Part 7 — Design-presence conditionals and the Phase 4 audit trail

The conditional branches the no-design tiers need in Phase 2 and Phase 4, where
design-bound findings re-route when no `design.md` exists, and how the adversarial
audit trail survives the `_workflow/` cleanup.

## Design-presence conditionals and the Phase 4 audit trail

**TL;DR.** D10 adds conditional branches keyed on whether `design.md` exists. The
no-design tiers skip the design half of the Phase-2 consistency review and the
structural duplication check; in `full`, the duplication check repurposes into the
seed↔track fidelity verification (Part 5) instead of firing backwards against the
now-mandated full track DRs. Design-destination bloat fixes re-route to track
sections in every tier, and findings that would defer to `design-final.md` land as
plan/track corrections where no design exists. A Phase-4 step folds the research
log's resolved adversarial verdicts into the tier's durable carrier (D16): `adr.md`
in `full`/`lite`, a two-line PR-description verdict summary in `minimal`. The audit
trail thus survives the `_workflow/` cleanup that deletes the log.

### Phase-2 conditionals

D10 keys Phase 2 on design presence, read from the `tier:` line. When `design.md` is
absent, the consistency review skips its design half (it reads plan + tracks + code,
not design + plan + code), and in `minimal` it lightens further to track-vs-code
because the stub plan has no content to cross-check. The structural review skips the
duplication check that compares a long decision record against its matching
`design.md` section, and `minimal` drops the structural pass entirely. These are
conditional branches, not a rewrite — the same passes run with the design-reading
clauses guarded.

The design-frozen findings-routing rule also collapses for the no-design tiers. With
a `design.md` present, a Phase-2 or Phase-4 finding that touches frozen seed text (a
D-record or mechanism section in `design.md`) defers to Phase 4; the live decision
itself remains track-routed (D7). With no design, every correction is plan-or-track
scoped, so the defer-to-Phase-4-design branch is unreachable and all findings route
to the plan or the tracks directly.

### Re-routing design-bound findings

D10 re-routes design-destination fixes in every tier, not only where no design
exists. All structural bloat fixes whose destination is `design.md` (the
decision-record, invariant, integration-point, and component-intent moves) re-route
to the matching track sections: routing live material into the non-canonical frozen
seed is wrong-direction under the carrier flip (D7) and unmaintainable after the
first replan, with post-freeze immutability the secondary argument. A finding that
would defer to `design-final.md` lands as a plan/track correction in the no-design
tiers. The full-tier duplication check repurposes rather than fires backwards: a
track DR matching a `design.md` section is the mandated shape, not bloat, so the
check becomes the seed↔track fidelity verification with Part 5's domain, qualifier,
and authoring-time-only restoration rules. The duplicate-DR consistency concern is
covered by the absorption and fidelity criteria at authoring and by the propagation
duty after.

### The Phase 4 audit trail

D10 closes the gap that relocating the adversarial review to a `_workflow/` file
opens: D6 moved the adversarial pass off `design.md` onto the log, so the log's
`## Adversarial gate record` holds the durable adversarial evidence base — in all
three tiers, since the log-adversarial gate runs in every tier (D17's persisted
per-iteration review files hold the detail and likewise die at cleanup). The Phase 4
cleanup deletes the log in every tier, so every tier folds the log's resolved
adversarial verdicts into a durable carrier, scoped by D16. In `full` and `lite`, an
`adr.md`-authoring step writes the fold by reading the log's `## Adversarial gate
record` resolved entries before the cleanup `git rm`, and `adr.md` survives the merge
into `develop`. In `minimal`, Phase 4 instead folds a two-line gate-verdict summary
into the PR description, which the squash-merge carries into `develop`'s `git log`;
the merge carries no `docs/adr/<dir>/` entry, and the full certificate trail survives
only in the PR's commit history on GitHub. Gate 2 is the boundary: a multi-track
change earns post-merge archaeology, a single-track `minimal` change documents itself
the way any small PR does. The verdicts never lived in `design.md` to begin with, so
`design-final.md` does not carry them. In `full`, `design-final.md` carries the
design rationale and `adr.md` carries the adversarial verdict trail alongside the
architecture decisions; the two are complementary, not a substitute for the fold.

The Phase 4 prompt that authors the final artifacts reads the `tier:` line before
touching `design.md`, so a `lite` or `minimal` final-designer never dereferences a
design file that does not exist. The §1.7(f) promotion machinery is unchanged: the
fold inserts around the existing promotion and cleanup ordering, not into it.

### Edge cases / Gotchas

- The relocated gate produces log verdicts in all three tiers and the cleanup
  deletes the log in all three, so every tier needs a durable verdict carrier: the
  `adr.md` fold in `full`/`lite`, the PR-description summary in `minimal` (D16).
  `design-final.md` carries `full`'s design rationale but not the adversarial
  verdict trail, which `adr.md` absorbs.
- A no-design tier that upgrades to `full` mid-flight (Part 1) gains a `design.md`
  and re-enters the design-present Phase-2 branches from the upgrade point onward;
  findings already routed as plan/track corrections are not retroactively moved.
- A `minimal` branch that is also workflow-modifying still runs its §1.7(f)
  staged-mirror promotion — the shed removes the fold, not the rest of Phase 4. A
  normal `full` change edits its target code directly and never populates
  `_workflow/staged-workflow/`.

### Staging for this workflow-modifying branch

This branch is itself `full`-tier and workflow-modifying, so §1.7 staging applied:
the live `.profile-b/**` files stayed at the `develop` state while staged edits
accumulated under `_workflow/staged-workflow/.profile-b/` until the Phase 4 promotion.
This kept the running workflow stable while the branch rewrote it, and is the reason
this design was authored under the prior live workflow rather than the rules it
proposes. The branch's own Phase 4 therefore ran under the inherited (pre-promotion)
workflow: the promotion commit copies the staged tree onto live, the final-artifacts
commit lands `design-final.md` and `adr.md`, and the cleanup commit removes the
entire `_workflow/` subtree, leaving only the two durable artifacts plus the promoted
workflow on the merge into `develop`.
