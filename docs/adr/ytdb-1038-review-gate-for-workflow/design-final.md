# Staging-aware review machinery — Final Design

## Overview

The development workflow reviews its own machinery at three points: a
plan-level review before execution (Phase 2), a track-level review before
each track is decomposed (Phase A), and a dimensional code review of each
track's diff (Phase B/C). An orchestrator picks which agents fire, and each
reads the relevant workflow documents to judge the change. Before this work,
every part addressed workflow files by their live `.profile-b/...` path.

The `§1.7` staging convention moved where that content lives during a
branch. On a plan that edits `.profile-b/workflow/**` or `.profile-b/skills/**`,
every authored edit accumulates under
`docs/adr/<dir>/_workflow/staged-workflow/.profile-b/...`, and the live files
stay at develop's state until one Phase 4 promotion. The review machinery
had not learned this, so on such plans it went stale in three ways:
selection picked the wrong reviewers, reading compared a change against
develop's version of a rule the branch had already rewritten, and the
Phase A criteria misfired on a track that edits prose.

The implemented machinery closes all three. Selection strips the staged
prefix before matching the triggers that pick dimensional reviewers. Every
review and gate prompt carries a caveat, gated on the plan's
workflow-modifying marker, that resolves a workflow document through
`§1.7(d)` precedence: the staged copy when present, the live file
otherwise. The Phase A technical, risk, and adversarial reviewers carry an
addendum, also gated on the marker, that re-points their criteria from Java
to prose.

The read side has a second facet. When a reviewed commit range first
creates a staged copy, the cumulative diff shows a whole-file add that hides
the real delta against the live counterpart; the orchestrator now pre-stages
that delta so the reviewer scopes findings to it.

The work split into three concerns, one per issue: selection (YTDB-1032),
the read side (YTDB-1038), and the Phase A criteria (YTDB-1046). The read
side carries two read-time mechanisms, the prompt caveat and the
orchestrator-staged review delta. The sections below map the components, the
two changed control flows, then one section per concern, and close with the
invariants that hold the change together.

## Core Concepts

This design rests on eight load-bearing ideas. Each is named once here and
used without redefinition below; the entry pairs the concept with what it
replaced so the delta from the baseline is visible.

**Staged subtree.** The copy of the workflow files that a branch authors,
kept under `docs/adr/<dir>/_workflow/staged-workflow/.profile-b/...` while a
workflow-modifying plan runs. Promotion at Phase 4 copies it over the live
tree. Replaces the model where a branch edited `.profile-b/...` in place.
→ §"Read-side staging awareness".

**Workflow-modifying marker.** The fixed sentence in a plan's
`### Constraints` that flags the plan as one that edits `.profile-b/workflow/**`
or `.profile-b/skills/**`. Its presence turns on staging and gates both the
read caveat and the Phase A addendum. Defined in `conventions.md §1.7(b)`.
→ §"Read-side staging awareness".

**Per-agent trigger.** The glob in the selection rules that decides which
workflow reviewer fires for a given changed file. Six reviewers exist; two
always run, the other four are gated on these globs. Lives in
`review-agent-selection.md` and its mirror in `code-review/SKILL.md`.
→ §"Selection-side staging awareness".

**Staged-path normalization.** Stripping the
`…/_workflow/staged-workflow/` prefix from a changed path before matching it
against the trigger globs, so a staged file is treated as its live
equivalent for selection. New in this design.
→ §"Selection-side staging awareness".

**§1.7(d) reads precedence.** The rule that a reader resolves a workflow
file to its staged copy when one exists and to the live file otherwise. The
amended `§1.7(d)` now lists two staged-first consumers — the implementer's
per-spawn read site and review agents on a workflow-modifying plan — so the
read caveat invokes a rule that already covers reviewers. Defined in
`conventions.md §1.7(d)`. → §"Read-side staging awareness".

**Staged-copy review delta.** When a track first creates a staged copy
inside a reviewed commit range, the cumulative diff shows it as a whole-file
add even though it is a copy of an already-live file plus a small edit. The
orchestrator pre-stages a `diff` of the live file against the staged copy and
scopes the reviewer to it. New in this design.
→ §"Read-side staging awareness".

**Phase A track review.** The pre-decomposition review layer: track-scoped
technical, risk, and adversarial reviewers plus a gate-verification
reviewer, run before a track is broken into steps. Their criteria assumed
Java code. Distinct from the Phase B/C dimensional review that the selection
and read fixes also touch.
→ §"Phase A criteria for workflow-machinery tracks".

**Mirror invariant.** The constraint that `review-agent-selection.md` and
the matching steps of `code-review/SKILL.md` change together in one commit,
with a sync-date bump. The selection fix touches both.
→ §"Consistency invariants and self-application".

## Class Design

This change adds no Java types. The components are workflow documents, the
rules inside them, and the two cross-file mirrors. The diagram models that
topology so the later sections can refer to it.

Four additions, four reaches. The normalization rule (selection, YTDB-1032)
lands in the mirror pair. The read caveat (YTDB-1038) lands in every review
and gate prompt across all three layers. The review-target delta pre-staging,
also under YTDB-1038, lands in the orchestrator's Phase C diff-staging and
high-risk Phase B step-review setup and surfaces to the two dimensional
context blocks. The criteria addendum (YTDB-1046) lands in the three Phase A
criteria reviewers only; the Phase A gate-verification reviewer is
criteria-agnostic and takes the read caveat alone. The marker gates the
caveat and the addendum; the normalization rule and the delta pre-staging are
keyed off the staged prefix and need no marker, because staged paths exist
only on plans that carry the marker anyway.

## Workflow

Two flows change. The first is how the orchestrator selects dimensional
review agents for a diff; the second is how any spawned review agent
resolves a workflow-document read. The read flow is the same for a Phase A
reviewer, a Phase 2 plan reviewer, and a Phase B/C dimensional reviewer.

### Selection flow

```mermaid

    A["git diff --name-only"] --> B{"path under<br/>_workflow/staged-workflow/.profile-b/ ?"}
    B -->|yes| C["normalize: drop the staged prefix<br/>to the .profile-b/... counterpart"]
    B -->|no| D["keep the path as-is"]
    C --> E["match per-agent trigger globs"]
    D --> E
    E --> F["dispatch the matched workflow reviewers"]
```

On a plan that does not modify the workflow, no staged path exists, so the
decision always takes the `no` branch and behavior is unchanged. On a
workflow-modifying plan, a staged file normalizes to its live name and
matches the globs its live counterpart would, so every reviewer that should
fire does.

### Read flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant R as Review agent
    participant P as Slim plan snapshot
    participant W as Workflow doc

    O->>R: spawn with the prompt
    R->>P: read the Constraints section
    alt 1.7(b) marker present
        R->>W: resolve the read via 1.7(d)
        Note over R,W: staged copy when present, else live
    else marker absent
        R->>W: read the live path
    end
    R-->>O: findings against the correct copy
```

The agent checks the plan's Constraints for the marker before it reads any
workflow document. The slim plan snapshot retains the Constraints section
verbatim, so the marker is visible from the snapshot the agent already
loads. When the marker is absent, the precedence rule reduces to reading the
live path, so the caveat is inert on ordinary plans and at a fresh plan
review where no staged copy exists yet.

## Selection-side staging awareness

**TL;DR.** On a workflow-modifying plan, the staged copy of a file is where
the change lives, but the trigger globs match the live `.profile-b/...` path. A
staged path begins with `docs/adr/...`, so three workflow reviewers never
match and fail to launch. A short normalization rule, added to the selection
rules and their mirror, strips the staged prefix before the globs run.

The file-set definition already counts anything under `docs/adr/<dir>/` as
workflow-machinery, so the two always-run reviewers (consistency, context
budget) fire on a staged diff, and the writing-style reviewer fires through
its `docs/adr/**/*.md` glob. The gap is the other three reviewers, whose
globs name `.profile-b/...` paths only:

- `review-workflow-prompt-design`: `.profile-b/skills/*/SKILL.md`,
  `.profile-b/agents/*.md`, `.profile-b/workflow/prompts/*.md`
- `review-workflow-instruction-completeness`: the above plus
  `.profile-b/workflow/*.md`
- `review-workflow-hook-safety`: `.profile-b/hooks/*.sh`, `.profile-b/scripts/**`,
  `.profile-b/settings*.json`

A staged edit to `.profile-b/workflow/conventions.md` lands at
`docs/adr/<dir>/_workflow/staged-workflow/.profile-b/workflow/conventions.md`,
which matches none of those globs, so the instruction-completeness reviewer
that should judge it never launches.

The fix is path normalization. Before matching the per-agent globs, the
selection logic strips the `docs/adr/<dir>/_workflow/staged-workflow/`
prefix from any changed path and matches the remainder. A staged file then
evaluates exactly as its live counterpart would. The rule heads
`§Workflow-machinery override` of `review-agent-selection.md` and the
mirrored Step 5d of `code-review/SKILL.md`, with the single canonical
`<!-- Last sync-checked … -->` date bumped in both. D1 records why one
normalization rule beats editing each glob.

A worked example in `review-agent-selection.md §Examples` shows the rule in
action: a staged edit to `code-review/SKILL.md` normalizes to its live name
and matches the `prompt-design` and `instruction-completeness` globs, so
both launch alongside the always-run consistency and context-budget pair and
the writing-style reviewer — five agents. No single changed file matches all
three glob-gated reviewers at once, because the SKILL/agents/prompts globs
and the hooks/scripts/settings globs are disjoint; the example therefore
shows two of the three firing, which is the realizable shape of the rule.

### Edge cases / Gotchas

- The writing-style reviewer already fires on staged paths through
  `docs/adr/**/*.md`. Normalization makes that intentional and removes the
  reliance on an incidental overlap; the writing-style outcome does not
  change.
- Normalization is scoped to the exact two-level
  `…/_workflow/staged-workflow/.profile-b/` prefix. A path that merely contains
  `.profile-b/` lower down does not normalize.
- The file-set categorization is unchanged: a staged file was already
  workflow-machinery by the `docs/adr/<dir>/` rule. Only the per-agent
  trigger step needed the prefix strip.

## Read-side staging awareness

**TL;DR.** Every review and gate prompt tells its agent where to read the
plan, the track file, and the workflow docs, and named the live `.profile-b/...`
path. On a workflow-modifying plan the agent should read the staged copy. A
caveat, gated on the marker and added to all nine prompts across the three
review layers, sends the agent through `§1.7(d)` precedence. A second
staleness affects the review target itself: when a changed file is a
freshly-created staged copy, the orchestrator pre-stages its delta against
the live file so the reviewer scopes to the real change rather than the
whole-file add (D5).

The caveat reaches every prompt that judges a change against workflow-rule
content:

- Phase B/C dimensional review: the canonical context block in
  `step-implementation.md` sub-step 4(a), its parallel copy in
  `track-code-review.md`, and `dimensional-review-gate-check.md`.
- Phase 2 plan review: `consistency-review.md` and `structural-review.md`.
- Phase A track review: `technical-review.md`, `risk-review.md`,
  `adversarial-review.md`, and `review-gate-verification.md`.

It is one short block inside the fenced prompt body of the two context
blocks, plus a one-line mirror in each of the seven other prompts. It says,
in effect: when the plan's `### Constraints` carries the canonical `§1.7(b)`
workflow-modifying marker sentence, resolve every read of a
`.profile-b/workflow/**` or `.profile-b/skills/**` file through `§1.7(d)`, taking
the staged copy under `_workflow/staged-workflow/` when present and the live
file otherwise.

The caveat self-gates on the marker, so the orchestrator no longer
hand-injects it per review (D2). The agent detects the marker from the slim
plan snapshot, which retains the `### Constraints` section verbatim because
the renderer copies the plan's strategic header unchanged and only filters
the track checklist. Placing the caveat in the prompt body, not as a
document section, keeps it out of the host file's section structure (D3).

The caveat invokes `§1.7(d)`, which as originally written scoped its
staged-first precedence to the implementer's per-spawn read site and excluded
reviewers, on the rationale that no such consumer had a staged copy to read.
On a workflow-modifying plan that rationale was the YTDB-1038 bug itself: the
reviewer does have a staged copy, and reading live is what produced the
phantom mismatch. So `§1.7(d)` was amended to list two staged-first
consumers — the implementer's read site and review agents on a
workflow-modifying plan — and the three live-only consumers (the drift gate,
the plan-slim renderer, sibling-track plan citations) each gained a
per-consumer rationale, replacing the stale shared one. The amendment landed
alongside the read caveat, rather than wording the caveat to override a rule
whose own text still excluded reviewers.

The caveat governs how a reviewer reads a *referenced* rule; a separate
staleness affects the *changed file* the reviewer is handed. On a
workflow-modifying plan a track's deliverable is a staged copy under
`_workflow/staged-workflow/.profile-b/...`. When that copy is first created
inside a reviewed commit range, the cumulative diff shows it as a whole-file
add, even though it is a copy of an already-live, already-reviewed file plus
a small edit, so the reviewer spends effort on already-promoted content and
risks phantom findings or scope creep into the live machinery.

The fix is orchestrator-side. In the Phase C diff-staging step and the
high-risk Phase B step-review setup, the orchestrator detects a changed file
that is a freshly-created staged copy (it matches the anchored
`…/_workflow/staged-workflow/.profile-b/…` prefix, is a new-file add in the
reviewed range, and has a live counterpart) and additionally stages a
`diff <live> <staged>` delta to a process-scoped temp file. The canonical
reviewer context block points reviewers at that delta and tells them to scope
findings to it, the rest of each whole-file add being verbatim-copied live
content. D5 records why orchestrator pre-staging beats reviewer-side
self-diffing.

### Edge cases / Gotchas

- At a fresh State-0 plan review no staged copy exists yet, so `§1.7(d)`
  resolves to the live file and the caveat changes nothing. The same is true
  at Phase A of the first track. It bites on a re-run `/review-plan`
  mid-execution, on a later track's Phase A, and in Phase B/C, once staging
  has produced copies.
- The two context blocks are parallel copies, not a shared include, so the
  caveat and the delta note must land in both with matching meaning. See S2.
- The gate prompts (`dimensional-review-gate-check.md`,
  `review-gate-verification.md`) already list the diff, plan, and track file
  as inputs; the caveat rides next to that input block. The delta note does
  not — it rides in the two dimensional context blocks only.
- On a plan that does not modify the workflow, the marker is absent and the
  caveat stays inert.
- Delta pre-staging fires only when a staged copy is *first created* in the
  reviewed range (a new-file add). A later edit to an already-restaged file
  is an ordinary diff, not a whole-file add, so no delta is staged. Like the
  selection normalization, it keys off the staged prefix and needs no marker,
  and the delta file is empty on ordinary plans.

## Phase A criteria for workflow-machinery tracks

**TL;DR.** The Phase A reviewers (technical, risk, adversarial) review a
track for Java soundness: find-class on every named symbol, WAL and crash
edge cases, data-format migrations, hot callers. A workflow-machinery track
edits prose, so those criteria misfire and the named-symbol check raises
phantom `NOT FOUND` blockers. A marker-gated addendum re-points the criteria
to prose; the same three reviewers self-adapt.

`track-review.md §Complexity Assessment` selects which reviews run by step
count and code cues, with no workflow branch, so a workflow-machinery track
gets the Java reviewers unchanged. On such a track the names in the track
file are workflow docs and `§`-anchors, not Java FQNs. The technical
reviewer's rule to verify every named class via `findClass` then has no
valid target, and the WAL, crash, migration, and caller criteria have
nothing to bind to.

The addendum is one block per criteria reviewer
(`technical-review.md`, `risk-review.md`, `adversarial-review.md`), gated on
the same canonical `§1.7(b)` marker sentence the read caveat uses and sitting
immediately after it. It re-points the criteria:

- verify named references as workflow file paths and `§`-anchors with grep
  and Read, not as Java FQNs via `findClass`, so a non-resolving workflow
  path or anchor is the finding and a non-resolving Java symbol is no longer
  a phantom blocker on a prose reference;
- supersede this prompt's Java-oriented criteria, including any WAL, crash,
  migration, and hot-caller concerns, with five prose criteria for the prose
  part: rule coherence and non-contradiction, instruction completeness,
  prompt-design soundness, context-budget impact, and breakage of dependent
  prompts or agents.

The same three reviewers still run; they read the marker and switch criteria,
mirroring how the read caveat self-gates (D4). Because the addendum
supersedes rather than appends, a track that mixes prose and code keeps both
lenses: the named-reference rule verifies prose anchors and Java symbols, and
the criteria swap applies to the prose part. The Phase A gate-verification
reviewer is criteria-agnostic and takes the read caveat alone, no addendum.
This fix builds on the read caveat reaching the same prompts, so it lands
after the read-side work.

### Edge cases / Gotchas

- The complexity-assessment dispatch is untouched: the same technical / risk
  / adversarial reviewers run, so a track that mixes prose and code still
  gets a single reviewer that applies both lenses by reading the marker plus
  the track's in-scope files.
- A workflow-machinery track names no Java symbols, so the read caveat and
  the addendum cooperate: the caveat points the reviewer at the staged copy,
  the addendum tells it to verify that copy's `§`-anchors as paths.
- `review-gate-verification.md` re-checks prior findings rather than
  generating criteria, so it needs no addendum.

## Consistency invariants and self-application

**TL;DR.** Three invariants hold the change together: the selection rules
and their `/code-review` mirror change in one commit (S1), the two context
blocks carry the same caveat and delta note (S2), and the read caveat and the
Phase A addendum stay uniform across the prompts that carry them (S3). The
fix also could not fix its own review: this branch staged its edits, so its
own Phase A and Phase C read the live, unfixed machinery, which the
`§1.7(h)` forward-only rule predicts.

The mirror invariant (S1) is stated in `review-agent-selection.md
§Maintenance`: that file and Steps 5a/5b/5d/6 of `code-review/SKILL.md`
mirror each other verbatim, every edit updates both in the same commit, and
the single canonical `<!-- Last sync-checked … -->` date is bumped. No script
enforces it; `review-workflow-consistency` catches drift at Phase C. The
selection fix touches a mirrored section, so it is bound by this rule.

The parallel-block invariant (S2) covers the read fix.
`step-implementation.md` sub-step 4(a) and `track-code-review.md` hold
separate but parallel copies of the context block. The caveat and the
review-target delta note land in both with the same meaning, or a Phase C
review would behave differently from its Phase B counterpart. The two blocks
read byte-uniform modulo two forced differences: the deeper code-fence
indentation in `step-implementation.md`, and the per-step versus per-track
delta-path token.

The uniformity invariant (S3) covers the breadth of the read and Phase A
fixes. The read caveat lands in nine prompts and the addendum in three; each
reads the same across its set, or a reviewer's behavior would depend on which
prompt spawned it. The three fixes share one trigger, the `§1.7(b)` marker,
so a future change to the marker's spelling touches every site at once.

Self-application is the last point. This plan edits the workflow, so per
`§1.7` it staged its own edits and the live machinery stayed at develop's
state until Phase 4. Its own Phase A and Phase B/C reviews ran against the
unfixed live rules. The orchestrator absorbed this by hand-injecting the
staging and prose-criteria guidance into review prompts during this branch's
execution, the same manual steps the fix removes for later plans. The fix
takes effect for the first workflow-modifying plan opened after this branch
promotes, which the forward-only rule in `§1.7(h)` describes.

### Edge cases / Gotchas

- `workflow-reindex.py --check` validates the TOC and stamp schema of the
  live tree; it does not validate the mirror and does not see staged copies
  during the branch. The mirror is the consistency reviewer's job; the
  staged copies are checked at Phase 4 promotion.
- Promotion is additive: the Phase 4 `cp -r` carries additions and edits,
  not deletions. These fixes only add text, so promotion is safe.
- Several `§1.7` subsections address reviewers in their prose yet annotate
  themselves with no reviewer role, so a reviewer following the `§1.8`
  read-filter cannot reach the rule that addresses it. This has no behavioral
  impact, because reviewers act through the prompt caveat rather than a
  direct `§1.7(d)` read; a future `§1.7`-wide consistency sweep should decide
  whether those subsections gain reviewer roles.
