# Speed up open() on databases with many collections — Design

## Overview

Opening a cleanly-closed disk database cost time quadratic in the collection
count. A recovery-time orphan-truncation pass ran on every `open()`, and for
each entry-point-equipped component it dispatched a `shrinkFile` that swept the
whole read-cache section map and rehashed. With one entry-point page per
component resident in the cache, N components each paid an O(N) sweep. A
4000-collection database took over two minutes to reopen, and a sampling
profiler put 97% of that in one hash-map sweep.

Two independent changes removed the cost. The first skips the pass entirely on a
clean open: a disk orphan, meaning a physical page past a component's logical
horizon, can only be produced by a crash, so a database that replayed no
write-ahead log on open has no orphan to truncate. The second makes the pass
cheap on the crash-recovery path it still runs on: the read-cache purge fires
only when the write-cache layer actually dropped pages.

Two enabling changes carry the design. A gate on the existing
`wereDataRestoredAfterOpen` flag, set only when `open()` replayed the WAL, wraps
the pass dispatch in `AbstractStorage.open()`. A `boolean` return on
`WriteCache.shrinkFile` lets the read-cache layer skip its hash-map purge when
nothing was truncated.

Two production assertions pin the premises each change rests on, and a
package-private dispatch counter on `AbstractStorage` lets tests observe whether
the pass ran, because file size alone cannot separate a skipped pass from one
that ran and found nothing.

The `WriteCache.shrinkFile` return-type change ripples to its two
implementations and five test mocks; the read-cache-concurrency-bug ADR, which
had recorded the pass as unconditional, is amended to record the refined gating.
The incremental-restore dispatch stays unconditional, and the in-memory engine
is unaffected. The rest of this document covers the core vocabulary, the touched
classes and the runtime flow, then four focused sections: why the dirty gate is
safe, the orphan lifecycle across crash and recovery, the read-cache purge skip,
and the relationship to the prior ADR.

## Core Concepts

This design turns on four ideas. Each is named here and used without
re-definition below.

**Orphan page.** A physical page on disk past a component's logical horizon
(`entryPoint.logicalPages`), so the file is physically larger than the component
counts. Produced when a physical extend becomes durable but its matching logical
advance is lost. → §"Crash recovery and the orphan lifecycle".

**The orphan pass.** `AbstractStorage.truncateOrphansAfterRecovery`, dispatched
near the end of `open()`. It iterates every entry-point-equipped component and
shrinks each file back to its logical horizon, re-establishing the invariant
that physical never exceeds logical. → §"Why the dirty gate is safe".

**Dirty gate.** A guard on the pass dispatch keyed to `wereDataRestoredAfterOpen`,
the flag set only when `open()` replayed the WAL. A clean open replays nothing,
so the flag stays false and the pass is skipped. Replaces the unconditional
dispatch. → §"Why the dirty gate is safe".

**No-op shrink.** A `shrinkFile` call whose target size is at least the current
file size, so nothing is dropped on disk. Before this change the read-cache purge
ran anyway; now it is skipped. Replaces the unconditional purge.
→ §"Read-cache purge skip".

## Class Design

classDiagram
    class ReadCache {
        <<interface>>
        +shrinkFile(fileId, targetBytes, writeCache) void
    }
    class WriteCache {
        <<interface>>
        +shrinkFile(fileId, targetBytes) boolean
    }
    class LockFreeReadCache {
        +shrinkFile(fileId, targetBytes, writeCache) void
        -clearFile(fileId, minPageIndex, writeCache) void
    }
    class WOWCache {
        +shrinkFile(fileId, targetBytes) boolean
    }
    class DirectMemoryOnlyDiskCache {
        +shrinkFile(fileId, targetBytes) boolean
    }
    class AbstractStorage {
        -wereDataRestoredAfterOpen boolean
        +open(config) void
        #truncateOrphansAfterRecovery(op) void
        ~orphanTruncationDispatchCountForTests() int
    }
    class StorageComponent {
        +verifyAndTruncateOrphans(op, readCache, writeCache) void
    }
    ReadCache <|.. LockFreeReadCache
    WriteCache <|.. WOWCache
    WriteCache <|.. DirectMemoryOnlyDiskCache
    LockFreeReadCache --> WriteCache : shrinkFile() returns truncated?
    AbstractStorage --> StorageComponent : verifyAndTruncateOrphans
    StorageComponent --> ReadCache : shrinkFile
```

Two contracts changed. `WriteCache.shrinkFile` now returns `boolean truncated`
(true iff the file was physically shrunk, false on the `fileSize <= targetBytes`
no-op), and `AbstractStorage.open()` reads the existing `wereDataRestoredAfterOpen`
field to gate the dispatch. `LockFreeReadCache.shrinkFile` keeps its three-arg
signature; only its internal decision to call `clearFile` became conditional.
`StorageComponent.verifyAndTruncateOrphans` and the orchestrator
`truncateOrphansAfterRecovery` are untouched: the gate sits above the orchestrator
at the `open()` call site, and the purge skip sits below the component helper
inside the read-cache layer.

The one added member is `AbstractStorage.orphanTruncationDispatchCountForTests`, a
package-private counter incremented inside `truncateOrphansAfterRecovery` and read
by same-package tests. It exists because the gate's observable effect on a clean
reopen is the absence of work, which file size cannot witness. `WOWCache` carries
both the two-arg `WriteCache.shrinkFile` (now `boolean`) and is the only
production implementation that physically shrinks; `DirectMemoryOnlyDiskCache`
returns `false` and keeps a separate three-arg `ReadCache.shrinkFile` forwarder
that discards the boolean.

## Workflow

    OPEN["open(): recoverIfNeeded() ran"]
    GATE{"wereDataRestoredAfterOpen?"}
    SKIP["skip the pass (clean open)"]
    PASS["truncateOrphansAfterRecovery"]
    COMP["per component: verifyAndTruncateOrphans"]
    SHRINK["readCache.shrinkFile(fileId, target)"]
    WC["writeCache.shrinkFile(): physically shrink?"]
    PURGE["clearFile -> removeByFileId (purge cache)"]
    NOPURGE["return (no purge)"]

    OPEN --> GATE
    GATE -->|false| SKIP
    GATE -->|true| PASS
    PASS --> COMP
    COMP --> SHRINK
    SHRINK --> WC
    WC -->|truncated| PURGE
    WC -->|no-op| NOPURGE
```

The flowchart shows both changes on one path. The gate decides whether the pass
runs at all; for a clean open it does not. When the pass does run (crash
recovery), each component's `shrinkFile` consults the write-cache result and
purges the read cache only on a real truncate. A clean component on the
crash-recovery path therefore reaches `NOPURGE` and pays no hash-map sweep. The
incremental-restore path in `DiskStorage.postProcessIncrementalRestore` dispatches
the same pass without the gate, because it always replayed pages.

## Why the dirty gate is safe

**TL;DR.** A disk orphan can only be produced by a crash, and a crash always
leaves the storage dirty, so an open that replayed no WAL faces no orphan. The
gate on `wereDataRestoredAfterOpen` skips the pass exactly when there is nothing
to truncate, and runs it on every WAL-replay open, which preserves the
physical-never-exceeds-logical invariant.

The pass dispatch sits at `AbstractStorage.open()` after `recoverIfNeeded()`.
That method sets `wereDataRestoredAfterOpen = true` only when `isDirty()` holds
at entry, then replays the WAL and flushes. By the dispatch site the dirty flag
has been cleared by `flushAllData -> clearStorageDirty`, so the field, not a
fresh `isDirty()` read, is the correct signal for "this open replayed the WAL".

The safety argument rests on a single premise about rollback. On the disk engine,
`allocatePageForWrite` produces a stub overlay with a null cache pointer and
performs no physical work. Every physical extend, dirty-page install, and
`EnsurePageIsValidInFileTask` submission happens inside `commitChanges`, which
`AtomicOperationsManager.endAtomicOperation` invokes only when the operation is
not rolling back. A rolled-back transaction therefore writes nothing to disk and
dirties no cache page. The remaining way to reach a physical-greater-than-logical
state is a crash that makes a physical extend durable while losing the matching
logical advance from a discarded WAL unit, and a crash sets the dirty flag that
drives the next open into WAL replay.

Tracing every disk-write primitive back to its callers finds none reachable from
a rolled-back, cleanly-closed transaction. The load-bearing line is the rollback
check at `endAtomicOperation`, which skips `commitChanges` wholesale; the
`if (!rollback)` inside `commitChanges` guards only snapshot-buffer flushing and
would not protect the physical apply on its own. A production `assert
!operation.isRollbackInProgress()`, placed immediately before the `commitChanges`
call, fires under `-ea` if a future refactor ever routes a rolled-back operation
into that path. The assert is structurally redundant against today's enclosing
`if`, and that is the point: it converts a silent breakage of the gate's premise
into a loud test failure.

### Edge cases / Gotchas

- The premise lives in the caller (`endAtomicOperation`), not inside
  `commitChanges`. A future refactor that made `commitChanges` callable on a
  rolled-back operation would break the gate's safety silently; the assert
  above surfaces that break as a test failure.
- `wereDataRestoredAfterOpen` is never reset. On a reused storage instance it
  could read stale-true, which only forces an unnecessary (and now cheap) pass.
  It can never read stale-false, so the gate never skips a needed pass. The
  field is shared with `IndexManagerEmbedded.autoRecreateIndexesAfterCrash`,
  which reads it with the same "did this open replay WAL" meaning; resetting it
  on close would broaden that consumer's blast radius for no gain.
- Incremental restore keeps an unconditional dispatch in
  `DiskStorage.postProcessIncrementalRestore`: it always replayed pages and must
  always re-establish the invariant.
- The crash-only premise also rests on reads never extending a file.
  `WOWCache.loadOrAdd`, reached on the read path through
  `LockFreeReadCache.doLoad`, does extend for any `pageIndex >= currentSize`.
  But every production read is bounded below the file's extent (by the
  component's logical horizon via `getLastPage`/entry point, by physical size
  for entry-point-less components, or by a stored page pointer), so a correct
  component never triggers it. A read reaches an out-of-range index only under a
  pre-existing `logical > physical` state, which is itself crash-only and
  repaired by WAL replay. The assert pins only the write-path half of this
  premise; the read-extend half is a component-correctness invariant, not
  assertable at that point.

## Crash recovery and the orphan lifecycle

**TL;DR.** An orphan exists only between the crash that created it and the first
WAL-replay open that follows. That open is dirty by construction, so the gated
pass runs and truncates the orphan before any non-recovery transaction. After a
clean close there is no orphan, so the next clean open has nothing to do.

A transaction that extends a file logs its page operations and its
logical-counter advance in one WAL atomic unit. A crash before the unit's end
record discards the unit on replay, so the logical advance is lost. If the
physical extend reached disk (through a flushed dirty page or an ensure-valid
task), the file is now physically longer than the component counts: an orphan.

The next open sees a dirty flag, replays the WAL, sets
`wereDataRestoredAfterOpen`, and reaches the gated dispatch with the flag true.
The pass runs, reads each component's logical horizon from its entry point, and
shrinks the file back to that horizon. The orphan is gone before the storage
opens for normal use. A subsequent graceful close writes no new orphan, so the
following clean open skips the pass and still satisfies the invariant.

### Edge cases / Gotchas

- The pass is best-effort: a per-component failure logs a warning and continues.
  Under the gate, a component whose truncation failed at the one dirty reopen is
  not retried on a later clean reopen. The two failure shapes differ. An
  unreadable entry point means the component is already corrupt and handled by
  the storage-corruption runbook. A transient `shrinkFile` IOException on an
  otherwise readable component is the one genuinely-lost cross-cycle retry; it is
  accepted as bounded because it is loud (a WARN at the failed reopen) and
  re-armed by any later crash.
- "Pass skipped" is observed in tests through
  `AbstractStorage.orphanTruncationDispatchCountForTests`, not file size, since a
  clean reopen and a dirty-but-orphan-free reopen leave identical files but
  differ in whether the pass dispatched.
- WAL replay applies a closed unit's page operations without consulting a
  rollback flag, but a rolled-back transaction writes no closed end record, so
  its unit is discarded rather than replayed.

## Read-cache purge skip

**TL;DR.** The read-cache purge inside `shrinkFile` evicts cache entries for
pages that were physically dropped. When the write-cache layer drops nothing,
there is nothing to evict, so the purge is pure waste. A `boolean truncated`
return lets the read-cache layer skip the hash-map sweep on a no-op shrink, which
removes the profiled hotspot on the crash-recovery path and on any clean
component the pass visits.

`LockFreeReadCache.shrinkFile` validates its target, delegates to
`writeCache.shrinkFile`, then before this change always computed a `minPageIndex`
and called `clearFile`, which sweeps every read-cache section under its write lock
and rehashes. `WOWCache.shrinkFile` already returned early when the target was at
least the current file size, but its `void` return hid that no-op from the caller,
so the sweep ran regardless.

The change threads the no-op signal up. `WOWCache.shrinkFile` returns `false` at
its early return and `true` after a real `file.shrink`; `DirectMemoryOnlyDiskCache`
returns `false`; `LockFreeReadCache.shrinkFile` runs `clearFile` only on a `true`
result. The boolean is read off the same `getFileSize()` snapshot, taken under
`filesLock.writeLock`, that drives the early return, so the return is exact with
no recomputed compare that would reopen a time-of-check window. The purge is
correct to skip on a no-op because no pages were dropped, so no cache entry can be
stale. The unconditional purge paths used by `truncateFile`, `closeFile`, and
`deleteFile` reach the read cache through a separate two-arg `clearFile` and are
untouched, since those always drop pages.

### Edge cases / Gotchas

- The argument-validity guards in `LockFreeReadCache.shrinkFile` stay above the
  delegate, so a malformed target still fails fast before any truncate.
- A production `assert file.getFileSize() == targetBytes` follows the real
  `file.shrink` in `WOWCache.shrinkFile`. It pins that a `true` return means the
  file actually reached `targetBytes`, so a future refactor that reorders the
  return relative to the shrink trips under `-ea` instead of silently returning
  `true` on a file that did not move.
- The five test `WriteCache` mocks override `shrinkFile`; four keep their
  deliberate `UnsupportedOperationException` trip-wire (the migration changed only
  the return type), and one returns a test-controlled boolean. None drives a real
  disk truncate.
- `ConcurrentLongIntHashMap.removeByFileId` is unchanged. It is simply no longer
  called on a no-op; its own structure stays as-is because genuine orphans are
  rare and few.

## Relationship to the read-cache-concurrency-bug ADR

**TL;DR.** The prior ADR recorded the orphan pass as unconditional and explicitly
forbade `isDirty`-gating, on the argument that an orphan could survive a crash
then a clean reopen then a clean reclose. This design refines that record: the
disk-engine pass is now gated on WAL replay, justified by the rollback
zero-footprint premise that the prior ADR did not establish.

The prior invariant stated that after `open()` returns, every entry-point
component satisfies logical-not-greater-than-physical, established by the
unconditional pass. The gated pass preserves that invariant by a narrower
argument: the pass still runs on every open that could face an orphan, which is
exactly the WAL-replay opens. The "survives a clean reclose" scenario the prior
ADR feared does not arise on disk, because the first (dirty) reopen after the
crash already runs the pass and truncates the orphan before the clean reclose.

The amendment is preserve-with-scoping. The prior ADR's "not `isDirty`-gated"
discovery and its invariant note in `docs/adr/read-cache-concurrency-bug/adr.md`,
and the matching design-choice bullet in that ADR's `design-final.md`, now record
that the disk engine is WAL-replay-gated per YTDB-1039 and restate the
rollback-zero-footprint proof in prose. The general rule is retained for any
engine where a clean close could still leave a physical orphan: the in-memory
engine, whose rollback leaves eagerly-installed pages, keeps the unconditional
behavior, and its `shrinkFile` is a no-op regardless.

### Edge cases / Gotchas

- The amendment is documentation only; it changes no behavior in the prior PR's
  code beyond the gate this design adds.
- A stale `WOWCache.loadOrAdd` Javadoc that claimed "no production callers yet"
  was corrected in the same pass: the primitive is wired through
  `LockFreeReadCache.doLoad`, which `loadForRead` and `loadOrAddForWrite` share.
