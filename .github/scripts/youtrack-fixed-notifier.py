"""Mark YouTrack issues fixed for the commits in a deployed range.

Walks the commit titles in a git range (typically "since the last
successful deploy" .. "the commit this run deployed"), extracts every
YTDB issue reference, and for each referenced issue:

  1. Reads the issue's current State.
  2. Skips the issue if that State is already resolved (Fixed, Verified,
     Closed, Won't fix, Duplicate, Obsolete, Done, ...). "Resolved" is
     decided by YouTrack's own `isResolved` flag on the state value, not
     by a hardcoded name list, so the set stays correct as states are
     added or renamed.
  3. Otherwise adds a "Fixed in <version>" comment and moves the State to
     Fixed.

Issue references are matched as `YTDB-<n>` (case-insensitive) anywhere in
a commit title, which covers all the shapes the repo produces:
`YTDB-123: ...`, `[YTDB-123] ...`, and the comma-separated pair
`YTDB-123, YTDB-456: ...`. Duplicate references across the range are
processed once. A commit whose subject begins with `revert ` (matched
case-insensitively) is skipped: reverting a change undoes it, so it must not
re-mark the reverted issue as fixed (git and GitHub produce the canonical
`Revert "<subject>"` form; the case-insensitive match also catches a
hand-written lower-case revert).

A single bad issue (network error, transition rejected) does not abort
the run: the failure is logged and the script exits non-zero at the end
so the CI step is marked failed for follow-up, while every other issue is
still processed.
