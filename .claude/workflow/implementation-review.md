## Overview
<!-- roles=orchestrator,reviewer-plan phases=2 summary="What Phase 2 plan review covers and when it runs." -->

Phase 2 validates the plan before track execution begins. It runs **autonomously** —
the orchestrator applies mechanical fixes itself and escalates only **design-level**
decisions to the user (missing Decision Records, track contradictions, target-state
vs. current-state ambiguity, ASPIRATIONAL/VIOLATED invariants). Two steps run in
sequence:

1. **Consistency Review** — reads the design document, implementation plan,
   track files (one per pending track), and actual codebase to find gaps and
   inconsistencies between them. Each finding carries a
   `Classification: mechanical | design-decision` tag emitted by the
   sub-agent. Mechanical fixes apply automatically; design decisions are
   batched and escalated to the user once at the end of the step.
2. **Structural Review** — validates plan-internal structure (dependency
   ordering, track sizing, scope indicators, architecture notes, bloat).
   All bloat findings are classified `mechanical` by construction; ordering
   and contradiction findings classify as `design-decision`. Same
   autonomous flow.

After both steps pass, the orchestrator marks `## Plan Review` as `[x]` in the
plan file (with a brief audit summary), commits the workflow update, and ends
the session. The next `/execute-tracks` invocation enters State A (pre-Phase-A
— the Track Pre-Flight gate runs against Track 1, with Panel 1 skipped because
no track has completed yet).

**Division of labor with the design mutation discipline.** Phase 2
does **not** separately review the narrative quality of `design.md`
(per-section shape, top-level caps, consolidation form, D/S code
discipline, length-trigger compliance, etc.). Those checks are
gated at **write time** by the Phase-1 authoring action (Step 4a
`edit-design` `phase1-creation`) defined in
design-document-rules.md:final-designer,planner,reviewer-design:1,4 § Mutation
discipline — every modification to `design.md` runs the
mechanical checks + cold-read sub-agent before the change stands,
and the design is frozen once Phase 1 closes. Phase 2's Consistency
Review still verifies design ↔ code ↔ plan alignment read-only (are
the diagrams accurate and the cross-links resolvable) and records
divergences; it does not modify `design.md`. The Structural Review
still owns plan-internal quality. Narrative readability of the design
document is the Phase-1 authoring action's responsibility.

## How to run
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="Entry points and preconditions for launching the review." -->

Phase 2 has two entry points:

1. **Autonomous (default).** Triggered by `/execute-tracks` when the startup
   protocol detects State 0 (plan file's `## Plan Review` entry is `[ ]` or
   missing). The orchestrator loads this document on-demand and runs the flow
   below.
2. **Manual re-run.** The user runs `/review-plan` to re-validate the plan
   after inline replanning produced a revised plan, or to audit the plan
   independently. The skill at `.profile-b/skills/review-plan/SKILL.md` loads
   this document and runs the same flow regardless of the current `## Plan
   Review` checkbox state.

Both entry points share the same orchestration. The only difference is what
the orchestrator does after the flow completes:
- Autonomous entry: marks `## Plan Review` as `[x]`, commits, ends the
  session so the next `/execute-tracks` enters Phase A of Track 1.
- Manual re-entry: marks `## Plan Review` as `[x]` (re-stamping with the
  fresh iteration count), commits, ends the session.

### Precondition (both entry points)
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="State that must hold before either entry point starts." -->

**Resolve active handoffs first.** If
`docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/handoff-state0.md` exists, complete
mid-phase-handoff.md:orchestrator,planner:0,1,2,3A,3B,3C,4 §Resume protocol
(including the resolution commit) BEFORE running the clean-tree check
below. The resolution commit deletes the handoff file and the PAUSED
marker line in `implementation-plan.md`, so leaving it for after the
check would dirty the very file the check is gating on.

Once any handoff is resolved (or there was none), check that the
plan-review files have no uncommitted changes:

```bash
git status --porcelain \
  docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/implementation-plan.md \
  docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/plan/ \
  docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/design.md \
  docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/design-mechanics.md \
  docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/design-mutations.md
```

The last two paths are checked when present — `design-mechanics.md`
exists only when the length trigger has fired, and `design-mutations.md`
is created on the first `edit-design` run. Non-existent paths produce
no output, so listing them is safe.

If the output is non-empty, halt and ask the user to commit (or stash)
those edits first — uncommitted changes to these files would otherwise
be bundled into the audit-trail commit alongside the auto-fixes,
muddling the trace. Other dirty paths in the working tree are safe to
ignore (the audit-trail `git add` is path-scoped to the files above).

---

## Tier-driven pass selection (D9/D10)
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="Phase-2 passes key off the tier line: per-tier consistency shape, minimal drops structural, design-presence guards." -->

Which Phase-2 passes run, and in what shape, is keyed off the **confirmed
tier** (D9), not off a step-count axis. Before launching Step 1, read the
**D18 tier line** from `implementation-plan.md`, the single change-level
line `create-plan` writes at confirmation, carrying the tier
(`full` / `lite` / `minimal`) and its centrally-matched HIGH-risk
categories. The tier line is always present (the aggregator plan is
shape-complete in every tier, D1), and the Phase-2 consistency review
flags a plan that lacks it. The same line is read on every entry — a
fresh `/execute-tracks` State-0 session and a manual `/review-plan` re-run
both read it from the always-present plan.

**Per-tier pass selection.** Each Phase-2 pass either runs as today,
narrows, or drops (the change-level half of the design's Part-6 review
matrix):

| Pass | `full` | `lite` | `minimal` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Step 1 consistency | full (design + plan + tracks + code) | drops the design half (plan + tracks + code) | drops the design half **and** the plan-content cross-check (track + code only) |
| Step 2 structural | runs | runs | **dropped** (the stub plan has nothing to check) |

The two narrowings are independent. The **design half** of the
consistency review is dropped whenever no `design.md` exists — that is, in
`lite` and `minimal`. The **plan-content cross-check** is additionally
dropped in `minimal` only, because the `minimal` stub plan is ~10 lines
with one checklist entry and no decision content to cross-check; the
`minimal` consistency pass cross-checks track-vs-code only. `minimal` also
**drops the Step 2 structural pass** entirely: a stub plan has one
checklist entry, no decision records, and no ordering, so a structural
pass has nothing to validate.

**Design-presence guard.** The two narrowings reduce to one mechanical
test the orchestrator and the sub-agent both apply: **does
`docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/design.md` exist?** When it is absent
(every `lite`/`minimal` plan), every clause that opens, reads, cites, or
routes a finding to a design file is skipped. The passes are not rewritten
per tier — the same Step 1 / Step 2 flow runs with the design-reading
clauses guarded behind the design-presence test. A no-design dry-run of
the Step 1 flow must reach no instruction that dereferences `design.md`;
this is the track's no-design acceptance check.

**Findings-routing under no design.** With a `design.md` present, a
Phase-2 finding that touches frozen seed text defers to Phase 4 (see
§"`design.md` is frozen — Phase 2 does not mutate it" below). With no
design, every correction is plan-or-track-scoped: the defer-to-Phase-4
branch is **unreachable**, and all findings route to the plan or the track
files directly. The live decision always lives in the track regardless
(D7), so the only thing the no-design tiers lose is the deferral target,
not a routing destination.

**Mid-flight upgrade.** A `lite`/`minimal` plan that upgrades to `full`
mid-flight (the D12 ESCALATE path) gains a `design.md` and re-enters the
design-present branches from the upgrade point onward; findings already
routed as plan/track corrections before the upgrade are not retroactively
moved.

---

## Step 1: Consistency Review
<!-- roles=orchestrator,reviewer-plan phases=2 summary="The consistency pass: contradictions, missing links, mismatched counts." -->

Checks that the design document, implementation plan, and actual codebase
are aligned. Unlike structural review, this step **reads the codebase** to
verify code references, call flows, and class relationships.

Because the consistency review's findings are factual claims about the
code (a method exists / does not exist, a flow has these participants,
this class has these callers), they are reference-accuracy questions
under the rule in conventions.md:any:any `§1.4` *Tooling
discipline*. When mcp-steroid is reachable per the SessionStart hook,
the verification routes through the IntelliJ PSI rather than grep —
preflight via `steroid_list_projects`, and instruct the consistency
sub-agent to use PSI find-usages for symbol questions (its prompt
already contains this instruction). When mcp-steroid is unreachable,
fall back to grep with explicit reference-accuracy caveats in the
findings.

### What it checks
<!-- roles=reviewer-plan phases=2 summary="Consistency dimensions the reviewer inspects." -->

- **Design ↔ Code** (design half — `full` only): class diagrams match
  real classes, workflow diagrams match real call flows, complex-part
  sections describe actual behavior
- **Plan ↔ Code**: Component Map and Decision Records reference real
  constructs, Integration Points exist, track descriptions don't reference
  phantom code
- **Design ↔ Plan** (design half — `full` only): diagrams align with track
  descriptions and Decision Records, scope indicators are consistent with
  design complexity
- **Track ↔ Code**: each track's inline Decision Records and its
  in-scope/out-of-scope file lists reference real constructs (the track is
  the live decision carrier in every tier, D7)
- **Gaps**: plan elements without design coverage (design half — `full`
  only), design elements no track covers (design half — `full` only),
  codebase constructs the documents should reference but don't

The bullets tagged **design half** run only when `design.md` exists, i.e.
in `full`. In `lite`/`minimal` the design-presence guard (see
§"Tier-driven pass selection") skips them, and the review reads plan +
tracks + code (`lite`) or track + code (`minimal`). The **Plan ↔ Code**
and **Track ↔ Code** bullets are the plan-content and track-content
cross-checks: `minimal` also drops the plan-content cross-check (the stub
plan has no content to verify), running **Track ↔ Code** only.

Each pending track's detailed description lives in that track's
track file (`plan/track-N.md`, written by `create-plan` at Phase 1)
rather than inline in the plan file — split across the four
track-level sections (`## Purpose / Big Picture`, `## Context and
Orientation`, `## Plan of Work`, `## Interfaces and Dependencies`),
with any track-level Mermaid diagram landing under `## Context and
Orientation`. The consistency review reads the track files alongside
the plan, and reads each track's `## Decision Log` inline DRs as the
live decision content (D7).

### Sub-agent prompt
<!-- roles=orchestrator,reviewer-plan phases=2 summary="Prompt template for the consistency review sub-agent." -->

**Prompt file:** prompts/consistency-review.md:reviewer-plan:2

The prompt embeds the **intent-axis pre-screen** (current-state vs.
target-state) and the **classification rules** (see §Mechanical vs.
design-decision classifier below). Each finding the sub-agent emits
carries a `Classification` field — the orchestrator routes on that
field, not on severity.

### Gate verification
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="Confirming the consistency reviewer's PASS is well-formed." -->

**Prompt file:** prompts/consistency-gate-verification.md:reviewer-plan:2

### Autonomous orchestration loop
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="The iterate-until-PASS loop the orchestrator runs autonomously." -->

```
Iteration 1 (full review):
  1. Spawn the consistency sub-agent with plan, track files, design,
     codebase, and a review_file_path (see §Strategic review output path
     below). The sub-agent writes its structured output to that file in
     the review-file schema and returns a thin manifest.
  2. Partial-fetch the file's `## Findings` section; each finding is
     tagged Classification: mechanical | design-decision.
  3. Apply ALL mechanical fixes immediately:
     - Plan / track-file edits: native Edit.
     - A finding whose correction would touch design.md is recorded
       only — design.md is frozen after Phase 1, so the design.md
       correction defers to the Phase-4 design-final.md reconciliation
       (see §`design.md` is frozen — Phase 2 does not mutate it below).
  4. If any design-decision findings remain: batch-present to the user
     once (single message listing all open design questions with proposed
     alternatives). Wait for user resolutions. Apply user-approved fixes
     using the same plan-vs-design routing.
  5. Spawn the gate verification sub-agent with the updated artifacts,
     the iteration's findings, and its own review_file_path; it writes
     the verdict-producer manifest variant and the orchestrator
     partial-fetches its `## Findings`.

Iteration 2-3 (gate, then full re-review if structure changed):
  - If the gate finds new findings, classify and re-route as in iteration 1.
  - If iteration 1 fixes significantly restructured the plan or design
    (tracks reordered, classes/flows redesigned, scope indicators changed
    substantially), re-run the FULL consistency review instead of the gate
    to catch cascading inconsistencies.

Cap: 3 iterations. Findings IDs cumulative (CR1, CR2, ... CR6, CR7).
```

If blockers persist after 3 iterations, escalate to the user with the
remaining open findings and recommend returning to Phase 1 (Planning) to
rework the plan/design before re-entering.

**Context consumption check** (mandatory between consistency review,
structural review, and any iteration boundary, except after the final
gate-PASS commit): run `cat /tmp/profile-b-code-context-usage-$PPID.txt`.
If the level is `warning` (≥40%) or `critical` (≥50%), do NOT start
the next review or iteration. Save all work and ask the user for a
session refresh (see `workflow.md` §Context Consumption Check). If the
pause leaves State 0 mid-flight (for example, consistency review
passed but structural review has not run, or an iteration's
mechanical fixes are applied but the gate sub-agent has not yet been
spawned), write a handoff file at
`docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/handoff-state0.md` per
mid-phase-handoff.md:orchestrator,planner:0,1,2,3A,3B,3C,4. Capture the iteration
count, which classifier passes are done, and the verbatim list of
mechanical fixes that landed so the next session does not re-run them.

### Review output
<!-- roles=reviewer-plan phases=2 summary="Shape of the consistency review report." -->

The reviewer writes its structured output to the committed
`review_file_path` file (the durable record); the orchestrator
partial-fetches the file's `## Findings` for the iteration loop and
applies plan-side fixes via Edit to `implementation-plan.md` and the
affected `plan/track-N.md` files. A finding whose correction would
touch `design.md` is recorded only — `design.md` is frozen after Phase
1 and its correction defers to Phase 4. The off-context win is the
file's `## Evidence base`, which the orchestrator does not ingest; the
durable trace is:

- The committed review file under `plan/track-N/reviews/`.
- The resulting plan/design state.
- The gate-PASS commit.
- The audit summary written into the plan file's `## Plan Review`
  section (see §Audit trail below).

### Strategic review output path
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="The per-spawn review_file_path the orchestrator injects at the Phase 2 dispatch sites and partial-fetches from." -->

Both Phase 2 reviewers and their gate verifications are **strategic**
producers: each writes its structured output to a file in the
review-file schema (`conventions-execution.md` `§2.5`) and the
orchestrator partial-fetches the file's `## Findings` rather than
receiving the bodies inline. The orchestrator injects a per-spawn
`review_file_path` at each dispatch site, pointed at the `§2.1`
lifecycle home:

```
docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/plan/track-N/reviews/<type>-iter<N>.md
```

`<type>` is the producer (`consistency` / `structural`, or
`consistency-gate-verification` / `structural-gate-verification`) and
`<N>` is the iteration, so each fan-out unit writes a distinct file.
The reviewer `mkdir -p`s the `reviews/` directory and writes the file
in file-when-handed-a-path mode (each prompt's output-mode block);
supplying no path is the develop-state run that falls back to today's
inline output. The output path is what wires the producer prompts'
file-when-handed-a-path branch to a caller — without it the reviewers
would emit inline and the orchestrator would have nothing on disk to
fetch.

The orchestrator still ingests `## Findings` (its consumer is the
planner revising the plan, not an implementer), so the strategic side
keeps the partial-fetch; the on-disk win is the evidence base staying
off-context, not the findings themselves. Before trusting the manifest
index the orchestrator validates the manifest `findings` count against
`grep -cE '^### [A-Z]+[0-9]+ '` (the `§2.5` S4 check); on a
`CONTRACT_VIOLATION` flag or a count mismatch it falls back to a
whole-section read of the file rather than the partial-fetch (the
orchestrator/planner owns the strategic fallback per `§2.5`).

---

## Step 2: Structural Review
<!-- roles=orchestrator,reviewer-plan phases=2 summary="The structural pass: section shape, budgets, bloat." -->

Runs **automatically** after the consistency review passes, **except under
`minimal`** — the `minimal` tier drops the structural pass entirely (see
§"Tier-driven pass selection"), because a stub plan has one checklist
entry, no decision records, and no ordering for a structural pass to
validate. Under `full` and `lite` the structural pass runs. Validates
plan-internal structure without reading the codebase.

### What it checks
<!-- roles=reviewer-plan phases=2 summary="Consistency dimensions the reviewer inspects." -->

Dependency ordering, track sizing, scope indicators, architecture notes
completeness, design document structure, decision traceability, internal
consistency, and plan-file bloat.

Each pending track's detailed description (the subject of TRACK
DESCRIPTIONS checks, plus several cross-file bullets in TRACK SIZING,
SCOPE INDICATORS, and CONSISTENCY) lives in that track's track file
(`plan/track-N.md`, written by `create-plan` at Phase 1) rather than
inline in the plan file; the structural review reads the track files
alongside the plan.

**Full details:** structural-review.md:orchestrator,reviewer-plan:2,3A,3C

### Sub-agent prompt
<!-- roles=orchestrator,reviewer-plan phases=2 summary="Prompt template for the consistency review sub-agent." -->

**Prompt file:** prompts/structural-review.md:reviewer-plan:2

### Gate verification
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="Confirming the consistency reviewer's PASS is well-formed." -->

**Prompt file:** prompts/structural-gate-verification.md:reviewer-plan:2

### Autonomous orchestration loop
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="The iterate-until-PASS loop the orchestrator runs autonomously." -->

Same shape as the consistency review:

```
Iteration 1 (full review):
  1. Spawn the structural sub-agent with plan, track files, design, and a
     review_file_path (see §Strategic review output path below). The
     sub-agent writes its structured output to that file in the
     review-file schema and returns a thin manifest.
  2. Partial-fetch the file's `## Findings` section; each finding is
     tagged Classification: mechanical | design-decision.
     Per-prompt rule: ALL bloat findings classify as mechanical; track-ordering
     and contradiction findings classify as design-decision (see §Mechanical
     vs. design-decision classifier below).
  3. Apply mechanical fixes immediately (Edit for plan / track files).
     A finding whose correction would touch design.md is recorded only —
     design.md is frozen after Phase 1; the correction defers to Phase 4.
  4. Batch-escalate any design-decision findings to the user once. Apply
     user-approved fixes.
  5. Spawn the gate verification sub-agent with the updated artifacts,
     the iteration's findings, and its own review_file_path; it writes
     the verdict-producer manifest variant and the orchestrator
     partial-fetches its `## Findings`.

Iteration 2-3: gate or full re-review (re-run full review if fixes
significantly restructured the plan).

Cap: 3 iterations. Findings IDs cumulative (S1, S2, ... S6, S7).
```

If structural fixes significantly restructure the plan (tracks reordered,
tracks added/removed, scope indicators changed substantially), re-run
the full structural review instead of the gate check to catch cascading
issues.

### Review output
<!-- roles=reviewer-plan phases=2 summary="Shape of the structural review report." -->

Same as the consistency review — the reviewer writes its output to the
committed `review_file_path` file (see §Strategic review output path
above) and the orchestrator partial-fetches `## Findings` during the
loop; the durable trace is the committed review file, the plan-file
edits, the gate-PASS commit, and the audit-summary entry in
`## Plan Review`.

---

## Mechanical vs. design-decision classifier
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="Deciding whether a finding the orchestrator can fix or must escalate." -->

The classifier lives in the review prompts so the sub-agent emits the
classification alongside each finding. The orchestrator trusts the
sub-agent's tag and routes on it.

### `mechanical` — orchestrator applies the fix without asking
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="Fixes the orchestrator applies directly with no user input." -->

ALL of these must hold for a consistency finding to classify as
`mechanical`:

1. The plan/design claim is about **current state** — code that should
   already exist at the time of writing, not code a track will create.
   (Aspirational claims about target state are pre-filtered; see
   §Intent-axis pre-screen below.)
2. There is exactly one unambiguous correct rendering — rename to the
   actual class, update to the real signature, fix the participant
   name in a sequenceDiagram, drop a phantom reference, etc.
3. Applying the fix doesn't change what the plan is trying to achieve.
   Only the description is updated; the plan's goals, scope, and
   architecture are unchanged.

For structural findings, **all bloat findings** are mechanical by
construction (DR length, intro length, component-intent length,
integration-point length, plan/design duplication, superseded DR
retained, plan-file budget, missing track-reference annotation,
scope-indicator format). The fix follows the rule mechanically —
trim back to the four-bullet form, replace duplicated body with a
one-line link, delete the superseded DR, etc. The fix lands on the
plan file via `Edit`; it never moves material into `design.md`,
which is frozen after Phase 1.

A `mechanical` finding whose only correct rendering would touch
`design.md` (a class-diagram or sequenceDiagram correction in the
design document, for example) is still recorded, but the `design.md`
edit is **not** applied at Phase 2 — it defers to the Phase-4
`design-final.md` reconciliation (see §`design.md` is frozen — Phase 2
does not mutate it below). The plan-side or track-side half of such a
finding, if any, is applied via `Edit` as usual.

### `design-decision` — orchestrator escalates to the user
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="Findings that change design and require user choice." -->

ANY of these triggers `design-decision`:

- The discrepancy reveals a **missing Decision Record** for a non-obvious
  choice. The user has the rationale; the orchestrator does not.
- The discrepancy is a **contradiction between two tracks** (Track 1
  assumes X, Track 3 assumes not-X). Which one is right is a design
  call.
- An **ASPIRATIONAL invariant has no implementing track**. Do we add a
  track or change the invariant? Both are plausible.
- A **VIOLATED invariant** exists. Do we fix the code (track scope
  expansion) or restate the invariant (design retreat)?
- **Design ↔ code mismatch where the plan describes a target state**
  (a `[ ]` track is meant to create what the design claims) and the
  divergence is whether to keep the target shape or change it. The
  pre-screening rule (§Intent-axis pre-screen) catches the
  no-divergence case; what reaches this rule is genuine design choice.
- **Track ordering** issues where reordering changes the contract
  (e.g., Track B's scope mentions wiring X, but X is introduced in
  Track C — does B move after C, or does X move into B?).

The classifier rules belong in the prompt files — the orchestrator
does not re-classify; it acts on the tag.

### Intent-axis pre-screen (consistency review only)
<!-- roles=orchestrator,reviewer-plan phases=2 summary="A pre-screen on the consistency pass to separate intent drift from wording." -->

Before emitting any finding, the consistency sub-agent classifies each
plan/design claim along the **intent axis**:

- **Current-state claim** — the plan/design says something about code
  that should already exist (Component Map describing a current
  module's role, `design.md` class diagram describing pre-existing
  classes, Architecture Notes referencing today's SPI). Discrepancies
  here become findings.
- **Target-state claim** — the plan/design says something about code
  a `[ ]` track will create (`**What**:` bullets in the track's step
  file, forward-looking Decision Records, `design.md` sections
  describing the post-implementation state). The current code
  naturally won't match — this is **not a finding** unless the target
  is unreachable from the current code (in which case the finding is
  `design-decision`).

The same rule already applies to invariants via the
`ENFORCED / ASPIRATIONAL / VIOLATED` tagging. The pre-screen extends
the same idea to all claims: a divergence with target-state code is
expected and silenced; a divergence with current-state code is a
finding.

## Audit trail
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="Where the review decisions are recorded for later reference." -->

Two durable traces survive the autonomous flow:

### 1. The `## Plan Review` section in the plan file
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="Recording the review outcome in the plan file's review section." -->

Before Phase 2 runs (or after `/create-plan` produced the initial
plan), the section reads:

```markdown
## Plan Review
- [ ] Plan review (consistency + structural) — autonomous; runs as the first phase of `/execute-tracks`
```

After Phase 2 passes, the orchestrator overwrites the section with:

```markdown
## Plan Review
- [x] Plan review (consistency + structural) — passed at iteration <N>

**Auto-fixed (mechanical)**: <CR/S finding IDs with one-line summaries>.

**Escalated (design decisions)**: <CR/S finding IDs with one-line user resolutions, or "none">.
```

If the user re-runs `/review-plan` later, the orchestrator overwrites
this section again with the new iteration's audit. The `[x]` checkbox
is what the startup protocol's State 0 detection reads.

If the section is missing entirely (a pre-existing plan from before
this convention), the orchestrator treats it as `[ ]` and runs the
autonomous flow, then writes the section for the first time at the
end. Pre-existing plans don't break.

### 2. The workflow-update commit
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="Committing the review result as a workflow-update commit." -->

After Phase 2 passes, the orchestrator stages the plan and the track
files (no design files — `design.md` is frozen and Phase 2 does not
touch it), and commits with the message:

```
Plan review autonomous fixes for <plan-name>

Auto-fixed: <CR/S IDs>
Escalated: <CR/S IDs, or "none">
```

This is a single Workflow update commit per the table in
`commit-conventions.md` § Commit type prefixes. Push after commit.

## `design.md` is frozen — Phase 2 does not mutate it
<!-- roles=orchestrator,reviewer-design phases=2 summary="Design frozen after Phase 1; Phase 2 records design-touching findings, defers them to Phase 4, fixes only plan/track." -->

`design.md` is frozen after Phase 1. The design-first authoring froze
it at Step 4a (the `edit-design` `phase1-creation` review pass), which
runs before plan derivation in Step 4b and before Phase 2. So by the
time Phase 2 runs, the design is already frozen, and Phase 2 does
**not** mutate `design.md`.

A consistency finding whose correction would touch `design.md` is
recorded as a finding only. The plan-side or track-side correction is
applied via `Edit`; the `design.md` correction itself is deferred to
the Phase-4 `design-final.md` reconciliation against the real code,
where the final-designer reconciles the design's narrative with what
was actually built.

**This whole deferral mechanism applies only when a `design.md` exists,
i.e. in `full`.** In `lite`/`minimal` no design file exists (see
§"Tier-driven pass selection"), so no finding can touch frozen seed text:
the defer-to-Phase-4-design branch is unreachable and every correction is
plan-or-track-scoped, applied via `Edit` directly. The live decision lives
in the track in every tier (D7), so a no-design tier loses only the
deferral target, not a place to route the fix. A design-destination bloat
fix (one that would move live material into the frozen seed) re-routes
to the matching track section in **every** tier, including `full`, because
the seed is non-canonical under the carrier flip (the structural review
owns this re-route; see structural-review.md:orchestrator,reviewer-plan:2,3A,3C).

Plan-file and track-file edits use `Edit` directly (unchanged) — no
mutation discipline applies to those files.

---

## Replanning
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="When a Phase 2 finding forces a return to planning." -->

**Not a separate phase.** Replanning is handled within Phase 3
by the execution agent's ESCALATE flow (see "Inline Replanning
(ESCALATE)" in `workflow.md`).

**Why:** The execution agent reads all track episodes from the plan file
and can read/write it directly. It has the context to revise the plan
within the session. A separate phase would add unnecessary context loss.

**What happens on ESCALATE:**
1. Execution agent stops starting new steps.
2. Presents full situation to user (all episodes, what broke, what
   assumptions failed).
3. Proposes revised plan (new/modified tracks, reordering, removed
   tracks).
4. Spawns a structural review sub-agent to validate the revised plan
   (uses the same prompt as Phase 2 Step 2; classifier still applies).
5. On review PASS — updates the plan file with the revised plan and
   ends the session. Sets `## Plan Review` back to `[ ]` so the next
   `/execute-tracks` re-runs the full Phase 2 flow against the revised
   plan, picking up any new consistency issues introduced by the
   replan.
6. On review FAIL with persistent blockers — advises user to restart
   from Phase 1 (`/create-plan`) with accumulated episodes as input.

The only case that exits to Phase 1 is when the plan is so fundamentally
broken that incremental revision cannot fix it.

## Completion
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2 summary="Closing Phase 2 and handing off to track execution." -->

When both reviews pass:

1. Update `## Plan Review` with the audit summary (see §Audit trail).
2. Stage and commit the plan and track-file changes. Stage every
   track file the review actually touched (use `git status --porcelain
   docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/plan/` to find them; pass each
   modified path explicitly rather than the whole `plan/` directory
   so unrelated files don't sneak in). No design files are staged —
   `design.md` is frozen after Phase 1 and Phase 2 does not touch it,
   so any `design.md` correction surfaced by the review is recorded as a
   finding and deferred to the Phase-4 `design-final.md` reconciliation:
   ```bash
   git add docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/implementation-plan.md \
           docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/plan/track-<N>.md \
           ... (one path per modified track file)
   git commit -m "Plan review autonomous fixes for <plan-name>

   Auto-fixed: <IDs>
   Escalated: <IDs, or 'none'>"
   git push
   ```
3. Inform the user that Phase 2 passed. The next `/execute-tracks`
   session will resume per the startup protocol — typically State A
   (pre-Phase-A — Track Pre-Flight runs against the first incomplete
   track) for a fresh plan, or whichever state was active before the
   manual re-validation. Remind them that technical/risk/adversarial
   reviews will happen per-track during execution.
4. **Run self-improvement reflection.** Load
   `.profile-b/workflow/self-improvement-reflection.md` on-demand and
   follow it. Reflection runs even when Phase 2 passed cleanly —
   ambiguity in `implementation-review.md` itself, classifier
   misfires, or sub-agent prompt issues are exactly the kind of
   workflow-process friction this step is meant to capture. The
   protocol creates approved proposals as YouTrack issues under
   `YTDB` with the `dev-workflow` tag (or skips with a notice if
   the YouTrack MCP server is unreachable); reflection produces no
   commit. Then proceed to Step 5.
5. **End the session.** Do not proceed to Phase A of Track 1 in the
   same session — the session boundary is mandatory (see
   `workflow.md` §Session Boundary Rules).
