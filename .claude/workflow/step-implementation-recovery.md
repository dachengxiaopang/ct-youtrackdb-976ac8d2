This document covers the **non-happy-path** logic for Phase B (step
implementation):

- **Phase B Resume** — orphan-commit recovery when a session was
  interrupted mid-step.
- **Non-`SUCCESS` orchestrator handlers** —
  `escalate_to_user_then_respawn`, `apply_upgrade_then_decide`,
  `handle_failure`.
- **Post-Commit Handlers** — `rollback_and_handle_failure`,
  `rollback_and_escalate`, `rollback_and_upgrade`, plus the common
  `git revert` rollback procedure.
- **Step Failure**, **Two-Failure Rule**, **Track-Level Failure**.
- **Resume-side commit-pattern reference** for interpreting `git log
  {base_commit}..HEAD` output.

It is **loaded on demand** by the Phase B orchestrator. The happy path
in step-implementation.md:orchestrator:3B handles all
`SUCCESS` returns, the step completion gate, the per-step orchestration
loop, the dimensional review fan-out, the cross-track impact check,
episode production, and Phase B completion.

## Loading discipline
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="When this recovery doc is read during Phase B." -->

Read this file when **either** trigger fires:

1. **At Phase B Startup**, after `git log {base_commit}..HEAD`: if the
   log shows orphan implementer commits, orphan `Review fix:` commits,
   or a `Revert step:` commit at the tip, load this file before
   spawning the first implementer — see §Phase B Resume below.
2. **At result dispatch**, in the `match result.RESULT` block: any
   value other than `SUCCESS` (`DESIGN_DECISION_NEEDED`,
   `RISK_UPGRADE_REQUESTED`, `FAILED`) — load this file before entering
   the matching handler.

The happy-path session (clean startup, every spawn returns `SUCCESS`)
never loads this file.

## Phase B Resume — Incomplete Step Recovery
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="Detecting and resuming a step left incomplete by a prior session." -->

When resuming Phase B (session restart), the next `[ ]` step may have
been **partially completed** in the previous session — code committed
but episode not yet written. This happens when a session ends between
the implementer's commit and the orchestrator's episode write, e.g.,
because of a context-level session-end gate or unexpected session
termination.

**Detection.** After identifying the next `[ ]` step, check for orphan
commits — commits that exist but have no corresponding episode in
the track file on disk:

1. Scan `git log --oneline {base_commit}..HEAD` and classify each
   commit by subject prefix and the paths it touches (per
   commit-conventions.md:implementer,orchestrator:3A,3B,3C § Commit type
   prefixes). Each `[x]` step in the track file is expected to
   contribute exactly **three** kinds of commit, in order:

   - **Implementer code commit** — touches code (paths outside
     `_workflow/`); subject is the imperative summary of the
     step's change. Exactly **one** per `[x]` step.
   - **`Review fix:` commits** — code commit prefixed
     `Review fix:`. **Zero or more** per `[x]` step (one per
     dim-review iteration that surfaced fixes).
   - **Episode commit** — Workflow update touching only
     `_workflow/plan/track-<N>.md`, subject `Record episode for
     <step description>`. Exactly **one** per `[x]` step.

   Two other commit kinds appear in the log but **do not** count
   toward any `[x]` step's expected total:

   - **`Revert step:`** — a revert commit. With the implementer +
     `Review fix:` commits it cancels, it forms a self-contained
     "rolled back" group that is excluded from per-step counting.
   - **Other Workflow update** — touches only `_workflow/` but
     is not an episode commit (Phase 1 init, Phase A
     decomposition, Phase B base-commit recording, plan-
     corrections application, track-completion mark, inline-
     replanning update). These are workflow scaffolding and may
     appear anywhere in the log between or before `[x]` steps.
     End-of-session self-improvement reflection produces no commit
     — its output goes directly to YouTrack (see
     self-improvement-reflection.md:orchestrator,planner:any).

   For K `[x]` steps, the expected per-step set is K × (1
   implementer + N `Review fix:` + 1 episode), plus any number of
   non-episode Workflow update commits and rolled-back groups.
   Anything beyond this — typically an implementer commit (and
   possibly trailing `Review fix:` commits) without a following
   episode commit — is orphaned and belongs to the next `[ ]`
   step.

   **Crash between sub-step 7 (episode write) and sub-step 8
   (episode commit).** If the track file shows `[x]` for the most
   recent completed step but the corresponding episode commit is
   missing from the log, the previous session wrote the episode
   to disk but died before committing it. The working tree is
   dirty with the unwritten episode.

   **Episode-write reconciliation pass.** Sub-step 7 writes across
   up to four sections (Episodes block + roster flip in 7.1,
   Progress entry in 7.2, optional Surprises in 7.3, optional
   Decision Log in 7.4) and may be interrupted partway through. Per
   the invariant in
   step-implementation.md:orchestrator:3B sub-step 7.1,
   the roster `[ ]`→`[x]` flip is the primary marker for "episode
   written"; missing Progress entries can be reconstructed from the
   Episodes block. Before staging the dirty tree, run this check:
   for every `## Concrete Steps` roster line marked `[x]` carrying a
   `commit: <SHA>` annotation, verify that
   (a) an `## Episodes` block with header
   `### Step N — commit <SHA>, <ISO> [ctx=<level>]` exists, and
   (b) a matching `## Progress` entry
   `- [x] <ISO> [ctx=<level>] Step N complete (commit <SHA>)`
   exists. If the Progress entry is missing, derive `<ISO>` and
   `<level>` from the Episodes block header (both are present
   there) and append the missing Progress entry to `## Progress`
   before staging the file for commit. Surprises and Decision Log
   promotions are optional — no reconciliation required.

   Then stage and commit the track file (using the standard
   episode commit subject `Record episode for <step description>`),
   push, then proceed with the rest of resume. This must happen
   **before** spawning the next implementer — the implementer's
   `git reset --hard HEAD` would otherwise discard the episode
   write.
2. If a `Revert step:` commit is present at the tip (or near the
   tip with no implementer commits after it), the previous session
   rolled the next `[ ]` step back via §Post-Commit Handlers but may
   not have finished the orchestrator-side bookkeeping (episode,
   retry/split rows, risk-line rewrite, or user escalation).

   **Read the rollback reason from the commit body.** The first
   non-empty body line is `reason: <slug>` per §Post-Commit Handlers
   "Body format". Branch on the slug:

   **`reason: failed-review-fix`** — the review-fix respawn returned
   `FAILED`.
   - **Verify all four bookkeeping writes landed** before declaring
     the rollback fully recorded. The failed-step path writes four
     artifacts in sequence: (1) `### Step N — FAILED, …` block in
     `## Episodes`, (2) roster `[ ]`→`[!]` flip on the matching
     `## Concrete Steps` line, (3) `- [!] <ISO> [ctx=<level>] Step N
     failed …` entry in `## Progress`, and (4) one or more inserted
     retry/split `[ ]` rows (`(retry: …)` or `(split from failed
     step above)`). Roster `[!]` alone is not sufficient — a crash
     between writes 2 and 4 leaves `[!]` on the roster with no
     retry row to respawn from. If all four artifacts are present,
     respawn the implementer for the next `[ ]` row from
     `mode=INITIAL` with `step_base_commit = HEAD`. If any
     artifact is missing, run the same Episodes-derived
     reconciliation as the success-path crash branch above: derive
     `<ISO>` and `<level>` from the failed-step Episodes block
     header to fill in a missing Progress entry; for a missing
     retry/split row, surface the situation to the user (the
     `recommended_action` choice is not derivable from the
     Episodes block alone) and let the user pick `retry` /
     `split` / `escalate` before respawning.
   - If no `[!]` entry exists, write it now (reconstruct the
     `FAILURE` fields from the prose explanation in the revert body
     plus the git log of the reverted commits). Read the statusline
     per episode-format-reference.md:orchestrator:3A,3B,3C
     §Sub-step 0 — fall back to `unknown` on missing file. Capture the
     current UTC time as `<ISO>` (format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ`) by
     running `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ`, and use this same `<ISO>` for
     both the Episodes block header and the Progress entry. Append the
     failed-step `### Step N — FAILED, <ISO> [ctx=<level>]` block to
     `## Episodes`. Insert retry/split rows in `## Concrete Steps` per
     the implied `recommended_action` (default to `retry` when the
     revert body does not name one), append the matching
     `- [!] <ISO> [ctx=<level>] Step N failed — see Episodes §Step N (FAILED)`
     entry to `## Progress` (same `[ctx=<level>]` and `<ISO>` from the
     captures above), then respawn from the retry/split row with
     `mode=INITIAL`.

   **`reason: late-design-decision`** — the review-fix respawn
   returned `DESIGN_DECISION_NEEDED` and the user had not yet chosen
   an alternative when the session ended.
   - The original `DESIGN_DECISION` payload (alternatives,
     recommendation, exploration_notes) is **not recoverable** from
     the revert body — it was held only in the prior session's
     orchestrator state.
   - The track file is still `[ ]` (no `[!]` is written for this
     case). Respawn the implementer with `mode=INITIAL` and
     `step_base_commit = HEAD`. The new implementer either lands on
     the same design decision (and re-derives the alternatives via
     a fresh `DESIGN_DECISION_NEEDED` return) or finds a different
     path. Either is acceptable — re-derivation is the cost of the
     mid-escalation crash.

   **`reason: late-risk-upgrade`** — the review-fix respawn returned
   `RISK_UPGRADE_REQUESTED`.
   - Read the step's inline `risk: <tag>` token on its
     `## Concrete Steps` roster line. If it already names the
     upgraded level (the prior session wrote it before dying), no
     further bookkeeping is needed.
   - If the token still names the original level, apply the upgrade
     now: rewrite the inline `risk: <tag>` on the roster line to the
     new level (auto-applied for `medium → high`, paused for user
     confirmation on `low → high`) and append an override note to
     the same roster line (`override: upgraded mid-Phase-B during
     dim review (<reason from revert body>)`).
   - Respawn the implementer from `mode=INITIAL` with
     `step_base_commit = HEAD`.

   **Unrecognised slug or missing `reason:` line.** Treat as a
   contract violation: present the revert commit and the step state
   to the user and ask how to proceed. Do not invent a slug.
3. If implementer / `Review fix:` code commits are present after
   the last episode commit (or after `{base_commit}` if no episode
   commits exist yet) without a `Revert step:` at the tip:
   - The previous session committed code for the next `[ ]` step
     but didn't write the episode.
   - **Resume from the appropriate orchestrator handler** by checking
     the orphan commits' messages (see §Resume-side commit-pattern
     reference below for the patterns):
     - If any orphan commit message contains `Review fix:` → the
       dimensional review loop already ran. Skip directly to
       `on_success` from the cross-track impact check (sub-step 5)
       onward; reconstruct an `EPISODE_DRAFT` from the diff and the
       commit messages.
     - If no `Review fix:` commits exist → the dimensional review
       loop has not yet run for this step. Re-enter `on_success`
       starting at the dimensional review (the implementer's commit
       is already on disk; treat it as the implementer's `SUCCESS`
       return).
   - Then proceed to the next `[ ]` step normally.
4. If no orphan commits exist, spawn the implementer for the next
   `[ ]` step from `mode=INITIAL` with `step_base_commit = HEAD`.

**Why this matters.** Without this check, the orchestrator would
spawn an implementer that re-derives changes already committed,
potentially creating duplicate or conflicting commits.

### Resume-side commit-pattern reference
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="Commit patterns the resume logic matches to locate prior state." -->

When Phase B resumes and detects orphan code commits, it scans
`git log --oneline {base_commit}..HEAD` and uses these patterns
(the authoring side of the same patterns lives in
commit-conventions.md:implementer,orchestrator:3A,3B,3C § Commit type
prefixes):

1. **`Revert step:` commits** — the previous session rolled the step
   back after a non-`SUCCESS` review-fix attempt. The next `[ ]` step
   was already cleanly returned to its pre-implementation state by
   the revert. Read the `reason: <slug>` line in the body and
   dispatch per §Phase B Resume above — the bookkeeping differs by
   slug (write `[!]` for `failed-review-fix`; respawn-and-rederive
   for `late-design-decision`; verify-or-apply-upgrade for
   `late-risk-upgrade`).
2. **Episode commits** (`Record episode for …`, Workflow update
   touching only `_workflow/plan/track-<N>.md`) — mark the
   boundary between completed and in-progress steps. The most
   recent episode commit is the last fully-finished step.
3. **`Review fix:` commits** — indicate that a review-fix
   implementer applied changes. The same prefix is used at both
   levels (`level=step` in Phase B and `level=track` in Phase C); the
   discriminator is **position**:
   - **Phase B (`level=step`) `Review fix:` commits** appear
     interleaved with episode commits (one episode commit follows
     each completed step's implementer + Review-fix commits). They
     belong to the step whose implementer commit immediately
     precedes them.
   - **Phase C (`level=track`) `Review fix:` commits** appear
     strictly **after the last episode commit** — Phase B is fully
     done before Phase C runs (the `Step implementation` row in the
     Progress section is `[x]` before any Phase C spawn). They do
     not belong to any step; they are track-level fix commits.

   When an orphan Phase B `Review fix:` commit appears after the
   last episode commit during Phase B Resume, resume from episode
   production. Phase B Resume **never** encounters Phase C-fix
   `Review fix:` commits because Phase B Resume only runs while a
   `[ ]` step exists, and Phase C cannot have started yet. Phase C
   resume is owned by track-code-review.md:orchestrator,reviewer-dim-track:3C;
   it reads the Progress section's iteration count, treats the
   current HEAD as the gate-check target, and does not need to
   classify orphan commits since the orchestrator never edits
   source files itself.
4. **Implementer code commits** — touch code (paths outside
   `_workflow/`); subject is the imperative summary of the
   step's change. When an orphan implementer commit appears
   after the last episode commit without any `Review fix:`
   siblings, resume from the dimensional review loop.
5. **Other Workflow update commits** — touch only `_workflow/`
   but are not episode commits (Phase 1 init, Phase A
   decomposition, Phase B base-commit recording, plan-corrections
   application, track-completion mark, inline-replanning update,
   Phase C iteration-count Progress updates, Phase C iteration-
   failure Progress updates with the `FAILURE` fields embedded in
   the commit message body). They are scaffolding and **not**
   orphans regardless of position. End-of-session self-improvement
   reflection produces no commit — its output goes directly to
   YouTrack.

The track file on disk is the source of truth for which steps are
complete (have episodes). During Phase B Resume specifically, any
implementer or Phase B `Review fix:` code commits beyond the last
episode commit are orphans for the next `[ ]` step. A `Revert step:`
commit cancels the implementer + Phase B `Review fix:` commits it
reverts — together they form a self-contained "attempted and rolled
back" group that does not count toward any `[x]` step's expected
commits. This orphan-classification rule does not extend to Phase C
resume — Phase C-fix `Review fix:` commits are valid track-level
fix commits, not orphans, and Phase C resume relies on the Progress
section's iteration count rather than orphan detection.

## Non-`SUCCESS` orchestrator handlers
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="Dispatch table for each non-success implementer return." -->

Triggered from the `match result.RESULT` dispatch in
step-implementation.md:orchestrator:3B §Per-Step
Orchestration Loop when the implementer returns one of the three
non-`SUCCESS` results. These three handlers fire in **pre-commit**
modes (`mode=INITIAL` or `mode=WITH_GUIDANCE`); the equivalent
post-commit dispatch (from `mode=FIX_REVIEW_FINDINGS`) is in
§Post-Commit Handlers below.

### `escalate_to_user_then_respawn(step, result)`
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="Escalating a design decision then respawning the step with guidance." -->

Triggered when `result.RESULT == DESIGN_DECISION_NEEDED`. The
implementer has run the snapshot-and-diff revert sequence per
implementer-rules.md:implementer:3B,3C §Detection rules, so
the working tree is clean at `step_base_commit` (no commit was
produced, and no untracked files were left behind).
`result.DESIGN_DECISION` is populated with `context`, `alternatives`,
`recommendation`, and `exploration_notes`.

Verify `git status` is clean before continuing — a dirty tree at
this point is a contract violation; surface the discrepancy to the
user instead of proceeding.

1. Present `result.DESIGN_DECISION` (alternatives + trade-offs +
   recommendation) to the user via the existing escalation protocol
   in design-decision-escalation.md:implementer,orchestrator:3A,3B,3C.
2. On user response, respawn the implementer with:
   - `mode=WITH_GUIDANCE`
   - `Guidance:` set to the user's chosen alternative + any
     additional direction
   - `exploration_notes_echo` set to
     `result.DESIGN_DECISION.exploration_notes` so the new
     implementer skips re-derivation
3. The respawn's result re-enters the main loop at the
   `match result.RESULT` dispatch.

### `apply_upgrade_then_decide(step, result)`
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="Applying a risk upgrade then deciding whether to re-decompose." -->

Triggered when `result.RESULT == RISK_UPGRADE_REQUESTED`. The
implementer has flagged that the step is more invasive than its
tagged risk and has run the snapshot-and-diff revert sequence per
implementer-rules.md:implementer:3B,3C §Detection rules, so
the working tree is clean at `step_base_commit` (no commit was
produced, and no untracked files were left behind).
`result.RISK_UPGRADE` carries `from`, `to`, `category`, and
`evidence`.

Verify `git status` is clean before continuing — a dirty tree at
this point is a contract violation; surface the discrepancy to the
user instead of proceeding.

1. **Apply the upgrade in place** in the track file: rewrite the
   inline `risk: <tag>` token on the step's `## Concrete Steps`
   roster line to the new level and append an override note to the
   same line in the form `override: upgraded mid-Phase-B (<short
   reason from result.RISK_UPGRADE.evidence>)`. The decomposer-time
   category stays on the line for traceability. Downgrades are not
   permitted — see risk-tagging.md:decomposer,implementer,orchestrator:3A,3B,3C §Override
   rules.
2. **Approval flow:**
   - `medium → high`: auto-apply (no user prompt). Note the
     auto-apply in the next track-file write.
   - `low → high`: pause and confirm with the user before
     respawning. The bigger jump is more likely a planning miss.
3. After application/confirmation, respawn the implementer with
   `mode=INITIAL`. The next implementer's run is identical except
   downstream `on_success` will now run the dimensional review.
   No `exploration_notes_echo` is carried across — risk upgrades
   typically surface early, before substantial implementation
   exploration, so re-derivation is cheap and `mode=INITIAL` keeps
   the respawn contract simple. If the prior implementer's
   `RISK_UPGRADE.evidence` already names what was discovered, that
   text plus the rewritten inline `risk: <tag>` token on the
   roster line is enough context for the next implementer.

### `handle_failure(step, result)`
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="Handling a step failure: retry, split, or escalate." -->

Triggered when `result.RESULT == FAILED` from `mode=INITIAL` or
`mode=WITH_GUIDANCE` (pre-commit failure). For `FAILED` returns from
`mode=FIX_REVIEW_FINDINGS`, the dim-review loop dispatches to
`rollback_and_handle_failure` instead — see §Post-Commit Handlers.

`result.FAILURE` carries `what_was_attempted`, `why_it_failed`,
`impact_on_remaining_steps`, `recommended_action`, and
`failure_class`.

**Pre-step: push-only short-circuit.** If
`result.FAILURE.failure_class == push_only`, the step's content is
fine — Sub-steps 1–2 succeeded, the commit landed at HEAD, and only
`git push` failed (see
implementer-rules.md:implementer:3B,3C §Return contract).
The working tree is **not** clean at `step_base_commit` in this case
(the implementer's commit is at HEAD by design); the snapshot-and-diff
revert assumption documented below does **not** apply.

Skip the `[!]` write and retry/split inserts entirely. Instead:

1. Route the push failure per
   commit-conventions.md:implementer,orchestrator:3A,3B,3C § Push failure
   handling — `non-fast-forward` triggers
   branch-divergence-check.md:orchestrator:2,3A,3B,3C (gated
   to first per-session rejection); other shapes record-and-continue.
2. After the gate (or record-and-continue), run `git push` from the
   orchestrator to publish the implementer's commit.
3. If the orchestrator's push succeeds, `result.COMMIT` is now on
   `origin`. Synthesise the success path: treat the return as if the
   implementer had emitted `SUCCESS`, then run `on_success(step,
   result)` (step-implementation.md:orchestrator:3B)
   from the top so the dimensional review loop, gate checks, and
   episode write all happen on the now-pushed commit.
4. If the orchestrator's push still fails after the gate, escalate
   to the user with the step commit SHA and the `git push` stderr —
   the situation is no longer mechanically recoverable. Do **not**
   fall through to the numbered steps below; the commit at HEAD is
   good work that should not be marked `[!]` for content reasons.

The numbered steps below apply only to the default
`failure_class: content` path. In that path the implementer has
already reverted any uncommitted changes and removed any untracked
artefacts (the snapshot-and-diff revert sequence) before returning,
so the working tree is clean at `step_base_commit`.

1. **Write the failed episode** to the track file from
   `result.FAILURE`. Append a `### Step N — FAILED, <ISO> [ctx=<level>]`
   block to `## Episodes` with the failed-step field set (`**What was
   attempted:**`, `**Why it failed:**`, `**Impact on remaining
   steps:**`, `**Key files:**`), and flip the matching `## Concrete
   Steps` roster line from `[ ]` to `[!]`.
2. **Append a failed-step Progress entry.** Read the statusline per
   episode-format-reference.md:orchestrator:3A,3B,3C
   §Sub-step 0 — fall back to `unknown` on missing file. Capture the
   current UTC time as `<ISO>` (format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ`) by
   running `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ`; use this same `<ISO>` for
   both the Episodes block header in step 1 and the Progress entry.
   Append a single entry to `## Progress`:
   `- [!] <ISO> [ctx=<level>] Step N failed — see Episodes §Step N (FAILED)`.

   The `[ctx=<level>]` field is mandatory per D12 on both the
   Episodes block header and the Progress entry.
3. **Insert `[ ]` retry/split rows** per the existing protocol — see
   §Step Failure below for the retry/split formats. The new rows are
   appended to `## Concrete Steps` as additional numbered roster
   lines.
4. **Two-failure rule.** If the new `[!]` makes two consecutive
   `[!]` entries for the same logical step, stop and present both
   failed episodes to the user — see §Two-Failure Rule below.

The implementer never escalates directly; it returns `FAILED` with
`recommended_action: escalate`, and the orchestrator decides whether
to enter ESCALATE per inline-replanning.md:orchestrator:3A,3C.

### `handle_result_missing(step, result_text)` (contract violation, recovery required)
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="Recovering when the implementer returns no parsable result block." -->

Triggered when the implementer's return text contains **no parsable
`RESULT:` block** (or the block is truncated mid-field). This is a
contract violation per
implementer-rules.md:implementer:3B,3C §Return contract — the
implementer is required to emit a `RESULT` block before any exit,
including context/budget exhaustion. The same handler covers both the
top-level dispatch from `step-implementation.md` §Per-Step
Orchestration Loop (the implementer's first spawn never produced a
return block) and the inner `match fix_result.RESULT` dispatch inside
the dim-review loop (a `FIX_REVIEW_FINDINGS` respawn exited without a
block). This procedure mirrors
track-code-review.md:orchestrator,reviewer-dim-track:3C §Phase C Implementer
Handlers → `handle_result_missing`, adapted for the step level.

The most common causes are message-budget exhaustion mid-iteration, a
runtime crash or timeout in a tool call, or a runaway poll loop /
background task that the system terminated externally.

The orchestrator cannot dispatch on missing data and the
implementer's last actions are by definition uncommitted (a
successful commit always emits `RESULT: SUCCESS`). Recovery is
manual and requires user approval — do not auto-respawn.

1. **Kill any background tasks the implementer may have left
   alive.** Run

   ```bash
   ps -o pid,ppid,cmd -e \
     | grep -E 'mvnw|surefire|java.*test|pgrep -f' \
     | grep -v ' grep '
   ```

   and terminate orphaned PIDs with `kill -TERM <pid>`. Wait a few
   seconds for graceful cleanup, then escalate to `kill -KILL <pid>`
   only if they survive. See
   implementer-rules.md:implementer:3B,3C §Pacing long-running
   tasks → forbidden self-referential pgrep for the runaway-loop
   shape.

2. **Inspect the tree.** Run `git status --short` and
   `git diff --stat`. Three states are possible:

   - **Clean tree** — implementer reverted before exiting (or never
     began applying changes). Skip to step 3 with the **discard**
     option pre-selected; the spawn is effectively a no-op.
   - **Dirty tree, edits look correct on inspection** — the implementer
     applied changes but never committed. The **commit-as-is** option
     is viable if the orchestrator can verify the edits independently.
   - **Dirty tree, edits look incomplete or wrong** — the implementer
     was mid-edit when its budget ran out. Recovery is most likely
     **re-spawn from a clean state**.

3. **Present the situation to the user with three options.** Include
   the inspection output (a `git status --short` excerpt and the
   implementer's last visible message, truncated to a few hundred
   characters) so the user can choose informedly.

   The three options behave differently depending on the originating
   mode of the spawn that left the tree dirty:

   - **Re-spawn finalizer.** Clean the tree on the implementer's
     behalf (run the snapshot-and-diff revert sequence per
     implementer-rules.md:implementer:3B,3C §Detection rules
     — the implementer never reached its own revert path, so the
     orchestrator owns the cleanup this once), then re-spawn a fresh
     implementer with the original inputs. For a `mode=INITIAL` /
     `mode=WITH_GUIDANCE` step spawn this is the next attempt of the
     same step from `step_base_commit`. For a
     `mode=FIX_REVIEW_FINDINGS` respawn inside the dim-review loop,
     re-issue the same fix iteration with the same findings; **if the
     findings list was large** (≥ ~15 items or ≥ ~10 files), halve
     the in-scope subset on the respawn so the new spawn doesn't
     repeat the budget exhaustion. The halved-off findings re-surface
     in the next gate-check fan-out.
   - **Commit-as-is.** Only when the dirty tree's edits look complete
     and correct on inspection, and when the orchestrator is in a
     position to verify them itself. The orchestrator stages explicit
     paths (no `git add -A`), runs Spotless + targeted tests of the
     touched test classes + the coverage gate, and commits. The
     commit subject follows
     commit-conventions.md:implementer,orchestrator:3A,3B,3C: the implementer
     commit subject for `mode=INITIAL` / `mode=WITH_GUIDANCE` spawns,
     or `Review fix: <subject>` for `mode=FIX_REVIEW_FINDINGS` respawns.
     Then proceed to the next sub-step that would have fired on a
     `SUCCESS` return — for a step-level top-level dispatch this is
     sub-step 4 (dimensional review) onward; for an inner
     dim-review-loop respawn this is the gate-check fan-out. **Apply
     the test-additive carve-out** when
     `git diff origin/develop -- '**/src/main/**'` is empty for the
     spawn's diff. Record the gate as `n/a (test-additive)` and skip
     the coverage profile build. This is the only Phase B case where
     the orchestrator commits source-file changes directly — note the
     deviation in the eventual step episode so the audit trail is
     preserved.
   - **Discard.** Run the snapshot-and-diff revert on the
     implementer's behalf. For a `mode=INITIAL` / `mode=WITH_GUIDANCE`
     step spawn, treat the spawn as `FAILED` with
     `recommended_action: retry` and route through `handle_failure`
     (no commit landed, so no rollback is needed). For a
     `mode=FIX_REVIEW_FINDINGS` respawn, treat the iteration as
     `FAILED` and route through `rollback_and_handle_failure` — the
     prior step commits still need rollback.

4. **Iteration / step-counter accounting.** A `RESULT_MISSING`
   recovery consumes one iteration counter (inside the dim-review
   loop) or one step-implementation attempt (at the top-level
   dispatch) regardless of which option the user picks — the
   implementer was spawned, ran, and produced a commit's worth of
   state on disk; that has the same impact on the budget as a
   `FAILED` return. Update the Progress section with the new counter
   and a note (e.g., `- [ ] Step N attempt 2 (recovered from
   RESULT_MISSING via commit-as-is)`) and commit it as a Workflow
   update commit before the next action.

---

## Post-Commit Handlers
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="Handlers that run after a fix commit lands during review iteration." -->

When the dim-review loop's `mode=FIX_REVIEW_FINDINGS` respawn returns
a non-`SUCCESS` result, the prior step commits are still on disk.
The implementer's local revert
(the snapshot-and-diff revert sequence) only undoes its
in-progress fix attempt; rolling back the prior commits is the
orchestrator's responsibility.

The post-commit handlers all share a common rollback step:

```bash
# step_base_commit was captured at spawn time
git revert -n {step_base_commit}..HEAD
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Revert step: <step description>

reason: <slug>

<one-sentence prose explanation, drawn from
fix_result.{FAILURE|DESIGN_DECISION|RISK_UPGRADE}>
EOF
)"
git push
```

The HEREDOC form is required for any commit message containing a blank
line — `git commit -m "…"` with literal embedded newlines is fragile
across shells. This matches the project commit-message convention in
the repo's `CLAUDE.md` ("Committing changes with git"). The
`git push` after the commit follows the per-commit push rule in
`commit-conventions.md` § Push every commit (the revert is part of
the visible branch history on the draft PR).

**Body format (load-bearing for Phase B Resume).** The first
non-empty line of the body MUST be `reason: <slug>` where `<slug>`
is exactly one of three values, used by Phase B Resume to dispatch:

| Slug | Source handler | Resume dispatch |
|---|---|---|
| `failed-review-fix` | `rollback_and_handle_failure` | Write `[!]` if missing, insert retry/split rows, respawn `INITIAL` |
| `late-design-decision` | `rollback_and_escalate` | Respawn `INITIAL`; new implementer re-derives — if it returns `DESIGN_DECISION_NEEDED` again, escalate then |
| `late-risk-upgrade` | `rollback_and_upgrade` | Verify roster-line `risk:` token; apply upgrade if not yet rewritten; respawn `INITIAL` |

A blank line separates the slug line from the prose explanation.
Resume parses the body by reading the first body line and matching
against the slug table — do not vary spelling, capitalisation, or
position.

`git revert -n` stages the reversal of every commit in
`{step_base_commit}..HEAD` (the original implementer commit plus any
prior `Review fix:` commits in the same dim-review loop) without
auto-committing each revert. The orchestrator then commits once with
the `Revert step:` prefix per
commit-conventions.md:implementer,orchestrator:3A,3B,3C. After the revert
commit, HEAD's tree state matches `step_base_commit` — the new HEAD
becomes the next step's `step_base_commit` for any respawn that
follows.

The rollback preserves history (the original attempt, any review
fixes, and the revert all stay in `git log`), so future investigators
can see what was tried. This is the conservative choice for a
critical-systems project; squash-merge collapses the noise at the PR
boundary.

**Pre-revert assertion.** Before running `git revert -n`, verify
`git status` is clean. The implementer's snapshot-and-diff revert
sequence should have left it clean;
if not, that is a contract violation and the orchestrator surfaces
the discrepancy to the user instead of proceeding (a dirty tree at
this point usually means the implementer exited mid-write or the
user has manual edits in flight).

### `rollback_and_handle_failure(step, fix_result, step_base_commit)`
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="Rolling back prior commits then handling the failure." -->

Triggered when a `FIX_REVIEW_FINDINGS` respawn returns
`RESULT: FAILED` — the implementer cannot apply the review findings,
typically because the findings reveal a deeper issue than a
mechanical fix can address. `fix_result.FAILURE` carries
`what_was_attempted`, `why_it_failed`, `impact_on_remaining_steps`,
`recommended_action`, and `failure_class`.

**Pre-step: push-only short-circuit.** If
`fix_result.FAILURE.failure_class == push_only`, the `Review fix:`
commit content is fine — Sub-step 1's work succeeded, the commit
landed locally, and only `git push` failed (see
implementer-rules.md:implementer:3B,3C §Return contract).
Skip the rollback entirely. Instead:

1. Route the push failure per
   commit-conventions.md:implementer,orchestrator:3A,3B,3C § Push failure
   handling — `non-fast-forward` triggers
   branch-divergence-check.md:orchestrator:2,3A,3B,3C (gated
   to first per-session rejection); other shapes record-and-continue.
2. After the divergence gate completes (or record-and-continue), run
   `git push` from the orchestrator to publish the existing
   `Review fix:` commit.
3. If the orchestrator's push succeeds, treat the iteration as
   successful — `result.COMMIT` is now on `origin`. Resume the
   dimensional review loop in
   step-implementation.md:orchestrator:3B §Sub-step 4 as
   if the implementer had returned `SUCCESS`: the new `Review fix:`
   commit becomes the diff target for the next gate-check iteration
   (re-run only the dimension(s) with open findings, max 3 iterations
   total per the protocol). Do not run the rollback steps below.
4. If the orchestrator's push still fails after the gate, escalate
   to the user with the `Review fix:` SHA and the `git push` stderr —
   the situation is no longer mechanically recoverable.

The numbered rollback steps below apply only to the default
`failure_class: content` path. Reverting a good commit because
its push collided with concurrent activity would destroy work the
implementer already finished and validated.

1. **Run the rollback** (revert + `Revert step:` commit) per the
   common procedure above. The revert lands **before** any track-file
   write so that the only crash-recoverable state is "Revert at tip
   with step still `[ ]`" — Phase B Resume's Detection step 2
   handles that exact state via the `failed-review-fix` slug branch.
   That branch verifies all four failed-step bookkeeping artifacts
   (Episodes `### Step N — FAILED` block, roster `[!]`, Progress
   `[!]` entry, retry/split row) and reconciles any missing
   artifacts from the Episodes block; if the retry/split row
   cannot be derived (the `recommended_action` is not encoded in
   the Episodes block), the user is surfaced the situation before
   respawn. Reversing this order — writing `[!]` first — would
   leave a window where prior commits sit unreverted at HEAD with
   the step already marked `[!]`; Detection step 3 would then
   misattribute those orphan commits to the next `[ ]` step.
2. **Write the failed episode** to the track file from
   `fix_result.FAILURE`. Append a `### Step N — FAILED, <ISO>
   [ctx=<level>]` block to `## Episodes` with the failed-step field
   set, and flip the matching `## Concrete Steps` roster line from
   `[ ]` to `[!]`. The episode's `what_was_attempted` should
   describe both the original implementation and the review-fix
   attempt that failed; the `why_it_failed` field captures the
   underlying reason.
3. **Append a failed-step Progress entry.** Read the statusline per
   episode-format-reference.md:orchestrator:3A,3B,3C
   §Sub-step 0 — fall back to `unknown` on missing file. Capture the
   current UTC time as `<ISO>` (format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ`) by
   running `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ`; use this same `<ISO>` for
   both the Episodes block header in step 2 and the Progress entry.
   Append a single entry to `## Progress`:
   `- [!] <ISO> [ctx=<level>] Step N failed (review-fix path) — see Episodes §Step N (FAILED)`.

   The `[ctx=<level>]` field is mandatory per D12 on both the
   Episodes block header and the Progress entry.
4. **Insert `[ ]` retry/split rows** per the existing protocol —
   see §Step Failure for the formats. The new rows are appended to
   `## Concrete Steps` as additional numbered roster lines.
5. **Two-failure rule.** If the new `[!]` makes two consecutive
   `[!]` entries for the same logical step, stop and present both
   failed episodes to the user — see §Two-Failure Rule.

After this handler completes, `step_base_commit` for the retry/split
row is the new HEAD (the `Revert step:` commit).

### `rollback_and_escalate(step, fix_result, step_base_commit)`
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="Rolling back then escalating a design decision." -->

Triggered when a `FIX_REVIEW_FINDINGS` respawn returns
`RESULT: DESIGN_DECISION_NEEDED` — applying the review findings
surfaced a design decision that was not visible during the original
implementation. `fix_result.DESIGN_DECISION` carries `context`,
`alternatives`, `recommendation`, and `exploration_notes`.

1. **Run the rollback** (revert + `Revert step:` commit) per the
   common procedure above. The rollback removes the original
   implementer commit and any prior `Review fix:` commits because
   the surfaced design decision affects the step's premise — the
   user's chosen alternative may invalidate the original approach,
   so we start the next attempt from a clean slate.
2. **Present** `fix_result.DESIGN_DECISION` (alternatives + trade-offs
   + recommendation) to the user via the existing escalation protocol
   in design-decision-escalation.md:implementer,orchestrator:3A,3B,3C.
   Include in the prose that this decision surfaced **post-commit
   during dim review**, so the user understands the rollback context.
3. On user response, capture the new HEAD as `step_base_commit` and
   respawn the implementer with:
   - `mode=WITH_GUIDANCE`
   - `Guidance:` set to the user's chosen alternative + any
     additional direction
   - `exploration_notes_echo` set to
     `fix_result.DESIGN_DECISION.exploration_notes`
4. The respawn's result re-enters the top-level `match result.RESULT`
   dispatch in step-implementation.md:orchestrator:3B
   §Per-Step Orchestration Loop.

### `rollback_and_upgrade(step, fix_result, step_base_commit)`
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="Rolling back then applying a risk upgrade." -->

Triggered when a `FIX_REVIEW_FINDINGS` respawn returns
`RESULT: RISK_UPGRADE_REQUESTED` — applying the review findings
revealed the step is more invasive than its tagged risk.
`fix_result.RISK_UPGRADE` carries `from`, `to`, `category`, and
`evidence`.

1. **Run the rollback** (revert + `Revert step:` commit) per the
   common procedure above. The rollback removes the original commit
   so that the next attempt re-runs the implementation **with full
   dim-review pressure from the start** at the new risk level — not
   stacked on top of an implementation that was reviewed under the
   old risk level.
2. **Apply the upgrade in place** in the track file: rewrite the
   inline `risk: <tag>` token on the step's `## Concrete Steps`
   roster line and append an override note to the same line in the
   form `override: upgraded mid-Phase-B during dim review (<short
   reason from fix_result.RISK_UPGRADE.evidence>)`. The
   decomposer-time category stays for traceability. Downgrades are
   not permitted — see risk-tagging.md:decomposer,implementer,orchestrator:3A,3B,3C §Override
   rules.
3. **Approval flow** (same as `apply_upgrade_then_decide`):
   - `medium → high`: auto-apply (no user prompt). Note the
     auto-apply in the track-file write.
   - `low → high`: pause and confirm with the user before respawning.
4. After application/confirmation, capture the new HEAD as
   `step_base_commit` and respawn the implementer with `mode=INITIAL`.
   The respawn's result re-enters the top-level dispatch.

### Why rollback in all three cases?
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="Why post-commit recovery always rolls prior fix commits back." -->

The post-commit handlers always rollback rather than try to
patch-on-top because:

- **`FAILED`**: by definition the prior commit cannot be salvaged;
  retry/split needs a clean starting point.
- **`DESIGN_DECISION_NEEDED`**: the user's chosen alternative may
  invalidate the prior implementation. Starting fresh avoids
  carrying assumptions from the old approach into a new one.
- **`RISK_UPGRADE_REQUESTED`**: the prior implementation was reviewed
  under the wrong risk level. Re-implementing with full dim-review
  pressure from the start is the only way to get the review pressure
  the upgraded risk demands.

The cost is one rerun of the implementation. For a database project,
the alternative — leaving an under-reviewed commit on disk and
trying to patch it — is the wrong tradeoff.

---

## Step Failure
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="Recording a failed step and inserting retry or split rows." -->

If the implementer returns `RESULT: FAILED` with the default
`failure_class: content`, the implementer has already reverted
uncommitted changes and removed any untracked artefacts (the
snapshot-and-diff revert sequence). For pre-commit failures
(`mode=INITIAL` / `mode=WITH_GUIDANCE`) the working tree is now
clean at `step_base_commit` and the orchestrator proceeds directly
with the steps below. For post-commit failures
(`mode=FIX_REVIEW_FINDINGS`) the orchestrator first runs the
rollback per §Post-Commit Handlers, then proceeds with the steps
below; the retry/split rows below apply to both.

`failure_class: push_only` short-circuits this entire flow — the
commit at HEAD is good content that only failed to push. The
relevant handler (`handle_failure` or `rollback_and_handle_failure`)
runs its push-only pre-step instead of the rollback / track-file
write, and on success routes back through `on_success` rather than
the retry/split protocol below. See those handlers for the detail.

For the `content` path the orchestrator handles the rest. The writes
follow the same D12 canonical statusline-read-then-write order as
the success path (see
episode-format-reference.md:orchestrator:3A,3B,3C §The
four-section write checklist):

1. **Write the failed episode** to the track file from
   `result.FAILURE`. Read the statusline per
   episode-format-reference.md:orchestrator:3A,3B,3C
   §Sub-step 0 — fall back to `unknown` on missing file. Capture the
   current UTC time as `<ISO>` (format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ`) by
   running `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ`; use this same `<ISO>` for both
   the Episodes block header and the Progress entry. Append a
   `### Step N — FAILED, <ISO> [ctx=<level>]` block to `## Episodes`
   with the failed-step fields (`**What was attempted:**`,
   `**Why it failed:**`, `**Impact on remaining steps:**`,
   `**Key files:**`) — see
   episode-format-reference.md:orchestrator:3A,3B,3C
   §Failed-step Episodes block for the full template. Then append a
   continuous-log Progress entry
   `- [!] <ISO> [ctx=<level>] Step N failed — see Episodes §Step N (FAILED)`
   to `## Progress` (reusing the level and `<ISO>` from above).
   Finally flip the matching `## Concrete Steps` roster line from
   `[ ]` to `[!]`.
2. **Decide retry vs split** based on
   `result.FAILURE.recommended_action`:
   - `retry` — keep the `[!]` roster line and append one new
     numbered `[ ]` roster line to `## Concrete Steps` immediately
     after it, with a modified description indicating the different
     approach and a fresh inline `risk: <tag>`.
   - `split` — keep the `[!]` roster line and append multiple new
     numbered `[ ]` roster lines to `## Concrete Steps` immediately
     after it, each carrying an inline `risk: <tag>`.
   - `escalate` — present the situation to the user and consider
     entering ESCALATE per inline-replanning.md:orchestrator:3A,3C.
3. **Append a continuous-log Progress entry naming the inserted
   rows** so a resume reader can reconstruct the retry / split
   without re-deriving from the Concrete Steps diff. The continuous-
   log shape carries no `(N/M complete)` count to update — the
   roster line count in `## Concrete Steps` is the single source of
   truth.

### Retry representation in the track file
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="How a retry attempt is written into the track file." -->

```markdown
## Concrete Steps

1. Add histogram header to leaf page — risk: medium [!] commit: (failed)
2. Add histogram header to leaf page (retry: use page extension API) — risk: medium [ ]

## Episodes

### Step 1 — FAILED, 2026-05-16T15:10Z [ctx=info]
**What was attempted:** ...

**Why it failed:** ...

**Impact on remaining steps:** ...

**Key files:**
- `path/to/file.java` (modified before revert)
```

### Split representation in the track file
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="How a step split is written into the track file." -->

```markdown
## Concrete Steps

1. Add histogram header and serialization — risk: medium [!] commit: (failed)
2. Add histogram header struct (split from failed step above) — risk: low [ ]
3. Add histogram serialization (split from failed step above) — risk: medium [ ]

## Episodes

### Step 1 — FAILED, 2026-05-16T15:10Z [ctx=info]
**What was attempted:** ...

**Why it failed:** ...
```

The Progress entry above (step 3 of this section) records the
retry / split fan-out alongside the failure entry — e.g.,
`- 2026-05-16T15:12Z [ctx=info] Inserted retry row for Step 1 (use
page extension API)`. No `(N/M complete)` count is written; the
continuous-log shape replaces the prior step-count idiom.

---

## Two-Failure Rule
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="Escalating after a step fails twice." -->

The two-failure rule triggers when two consecutive `[!]` entries
exist for the same logical step (the retry also failed):

```markdown
## Concrete Steps

1. Add histogram header to leaf page — risk: medium [!] commit: (failed)
2. Add histogram header to leaf page (retry: use page extension API) — risk: medium [!] commit: (failed)

## Episodes

### Step 1 — FAILED, 2026-05-16T15:10Z [ctx=info]
**What was attempted:** ... (first attempt)

**Why it failed:** ...

### Step 2 — FAILED, 2026-05-16T15:45Z [ctx=info]
**What was attempted:** ... (second attempt)

**Why it failed:** ...
```

When this happens — whether during a session or detected on resume:

- **Stop.** Do not spawn another implementer.
- Present both failed episodes to the user with:
  - What was tried each time
  - Why it failed
  - Your assessment of whether this is a step-level issue or a
    track-level issue
- The user decides: retry with specific guidance, adjust the
  approach, skip the step, or escalate.

**On resume.** When scanning the step list and encountering a `[!]`
entry followed by another `[!]` for the same step — the second
entry's description carries either `(retry: …)` or `(split from
failed step above)` as the disambiguator — this is a two-failure
situation. Present both failed episodes to the user before
proceeding.

---

## Track-Level Failure
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3B summary="Handling a failure that the step scope cannot resolve." -->

If a failure undermines the track's overall approach (not just one
step — e.g., the track's foundational assumption is wrong, or
repeated step failures trace back to a common root cause the track
cannot address):

- Present the situation to the user with full context (affected
  steps, what was tried, the underlying issue).
- Recommend **ESCALATE** if the approach is fundamentally wrong
  (see inline-replanning.md:orchestrator:3A,3C).
- The user decides how to proceed.
