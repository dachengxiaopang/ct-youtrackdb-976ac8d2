<!--Document index end-->

Runs in turn 1 of every `/execute-tracks` session, immediately
after the auto-resume decision and before any phase work begins.
A diverged branch left undetected makes every per-commit push fail
non-fast-forward, and the workflow's "push every commit" safety net
silently lapses — the draft PR drifts behind local, and a
mid-session crash destroys work that was supposed to be backed up.

Re-entered mid-session when a per-commit `git push` is rejected
`non-fast-forward` for the first time in the session (routed from
`step-implementation.md` sub-step 8 and the central rule in
`commit-conventions.md` § Push failure handling). Subsequent
rejections in the same session do not re-route; the user's chosen
resolution applies for the remainder of the session.

## Detection
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2,3A,3B,3C summary="Detection moved to the script's divergence walk; this section cites the JSON the gate reads." -->

Detection no longer lives in this file. The upstream guard, the
`git fetch`, and the `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...'@{u}'`
ahead/behind count all run inside
`.profile-b/scripts/workflow-startup-precheck.sh`. The script reports
the `divergence` object under both `--mode full` (the startup
dispatch in `workflow.md § Startup Protocol`) and `--mode
divergence-only` (the mid-session push-failure re-check routed from
`commit-conventions.md` § Push failure handling). The script is the
single behavioral home; this file owns only the resolution UX below.
Cite the script's `emit_json` function for the exact field contract,
not any frozen design draft.

Both modes carry a `divergence` object the gate reads:

- `divergence.detected` — boolean. `true` iff **both** `ahead` and
  `behind` are non-zero (a purely-ahead or purely-behind branch
  fast-forwards in one direction and is not a divergence). `git
  status -sb` does not emit the literal word `diverged`, so the
  script does not grep for it.
- `divergence.ahead` / `divergence.behind` — the two counts as
  numbers (null on a skipped check). Surface them to the user when
  `detected` is true so the resolution choice is informed.
- `divergence.skipped` — boolean; `true` when the check could not
  run.
- `divergence.skip_reason` — `"no-upstream"` (the branch has no
  upstream tracking ref, so `@{u}` does not resolve) or
  `"fetch-failed"` (offline, removed remote, auth failure, or the
  startup `timeout 10 git fetch --no-tags` elapsed); null when not
  skipped.

When `divergence.detected` is true, surface `ahead` / `behind` to the
user and ask which of three resolutions to apply. Do **not** pick a
default — force-pushing or resetting without explicit consent violates
the harness git-safety protocol (see user-global `~/.profile-b/CLAUDE.md`).

**Skipped check.** `divergence.skipped == true` is the silent-skip
path: no upstream configured, or the fetch failed. The script reports
it as data and the gate does not run. The first per-commit push will
surface any later issue, and the session-end unpushed-commit report
(see `workflow.md` § What to do before ending a session) still covers
the silent-failure case.

**Parity-delta — the bounded startup fetch.** The startup `git fetch`
the script runs is bounded by `timeout 10 git fetch --no-tags`, so
session startup cannot hang on a stalled remote. Detection parity with
the old unbounded `git fetch` holds for every outcome except a
slow-but-reachable remote that takes longer than 10s: there the script
reports `divergence.skipped == true` with `skip_reason ==
"fetch-failed"` and the divergence goes unreported at startup. The
per-commit push re-check still catches a divergence a stale or timed-out
fetch missed: a rejected non-fast-forward push routes here mid-session
via `--mode divergence-only`. So the bounded fetch trades a rare benign
startup miss for a startup that cannot stall.

## Resolutions
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2,3A,3B,3C summary="Present the three divergence resolutions to the user and wait for an explicit choice." -->

Present all three options to the user, with the ahead/behind counts
already on screen, and wait for an explicit choice.

### Local-authoritative
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2,3A,3B,3C summary="Force-push the intended local rewrite over a stale remote, never with plain --force." -->

The local rewrite (rebase, squash, amend) is intended and the
remote is stale. Run once at startup:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

Per-commit push operates normally for the rest of the session.

Never use plain `--force`. If `--force-with-lease` itself rejects
(the remote moved after the local fetch), re-route to this gate
rather than retry blindly — the new remote state may invalidate
the user's earlier choice.

### Remote-authoritative
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2,3A,3B,3C summary="Discard local rewrites in favour of origin after confirming local-only commits are unrecoverable." -->

Discard the local rewrites in favour of `origin`. After explicit
confirmation that local-only commits are unrecoverable:

```bash
git reset --hard origin/<branch>
```

Workflow files (`docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/`) are restored from
the most recent reachable remote commit; any uncommitted local
changes are lost. Warn the user before running, and surface
`git log @{u}..HEAD --oneline` so they can confirm which local
commits will be discarded.

After the reset, the auto-resume decision computed earlier in the
Startup Protocol may no longer match the new HEAD. Re-run the
Startup Protocol's state dispatch
(workflow.md:orchestrator:2,3A,3B,3C,4 § Startup Protocol) — re-invoke
the precheck script and re-route on the fresh `state` object — before
proceeding.

### Defer
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2,3A,3B,3C summary="Let the user resolve the divergence manually after the session; per-commit pushes keep failing." -->

The user wants to resolve the divergence manually after the
session. Per-commit pushes will continue to fail throughout the
session but do not block phase progress.

Acknowledge the choice, then proceed. The session-end summary
reports the unpushed-commit count per `workflow.md` § What to do
before ending a session, so the residue is visible at session end
even though it accumulated silently across the session.

---

## After the choice
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=2,3A,3B,3C summary="The chosen resolution holds for the session; both rewrite resolutions return to the Startup Protocol." -->

The user's choice applies for the remainder of the session; no
re-check is required. Mid-session non-fast-forward rejections under
the **Defer** resolution are expected and are not re-routed here.

Local-authoritative and Remote-authoritative resolutions both
return to the Startup Protocol; the orchestrator then continues to
the phase-specific work for the auto-resume state.
