## Overview
<!-- roles=orchestrator,decomposer phases=3A summary="Phase A reviews and decomposes the upcoming track, gated by the Track Pre-Flight strategy assessment." -->

This document covers Phase A only. A track goes through three sub-phases,
each executed in a **separate session**:

1. **Phase A: Review + Decomposition** — this document (current session)
2. **Phase B: Step Implementation** — see
   step-implementation.md:orchestrator:3B (next session)
3. **Phase C: Code Review + Track Completion** — see
   track-code-review.md:orchestrator,reviewer-dim-track:3C (session after Phase B)

Phase C includes both the track-level code review and track completion
(episode compilation, plan corrections, user approval) in a single session.

---

## Phase A: Review + Decomposition
<!-- roles=orchestrator,decomposer phases=3A summary="The Phase A flow: tier selects reviews, sequential reviews, step decomposition, and the mandatory session boundary." -->

> **In this phase, you are a reviewer and planner, not an implementer. You
> NEVER edit source code, test files, or build files. You explore the
> codebase (read-only) to validate the track's approach and decompose it
> into steps. The only file you write is the track file
> (`plan/track-N.md`).**

### Tooling — PSI is required for symbol audits in Phase A
<!-- roles=orchestrator,decomposer phases=3A summary="Symbol audits during Phase A go through PSI via mcp-steroid, not grep; the preflight and fallback rules apply." -->

Phase A's outputs (review findings, scope-indicator validation, step
decomposition with risk tags) ride on reference-accuracy facts —
"this method's callers", "this interface's implementations", "no
existing consumer for this slot". When mcp-steroid is reachable per
the SessionStart hook, those facts MUST come from PSI find-usages
rather than grep — see conventions.md:any:any `§1.4`
*Tooling discipline* for the full rule (preflight via
`steroid_list_projects`, cwd-mismatch handling, fallback when
unreachable). Run the preflight once before the first symbol audit;
do not re-probe.

Two recipes in conventions.md:any:any `§1.4` *Recipes* are
particularly load-bearing during Phase A:

- **`hierarchy-search`** — when assessing a track that touches an SPI
  or an interface with multiple implementers (storage engines, index
  variants, SQL functions, collation strategies), load this recipe
  to enumerate every implementer / override before approving the
  track's scope. Grep on `extends X` or `implements Y` misses
  indirect chains and generic supertypes.
- **`call-hierarchy`** — when assessing a track that changes a
  low-level signature, load this recipe to walk the upward call tree
  and judge propagation distance. Immediate-callers grep is not
  enough at depths >1.

The Phase A review sub-agents you spawn (technical, risk, adversarial)
all default to grep unless their prompts explicitly route them to
PSI. The canonical prompts under `prompts/` already include this
instruction — keep it intact when customising.

### Pre-write rule — PSI-verify class names
<!-- roles=decomposer phases=3A summary="Verify every class/method name through PSI before it lands in a decomposed step or track-file claim." -->

Before any write that names a production class in the track file's
four Phase 1 track-level sections (`## Purpose / Big Picture`,
`## Context and Orientation`, `## Plan of Work`,
`## Interfaces and Dependencies` — including light amendments
committed via the Track Pre-Flight gate's step 4) or in decomposed
step bodies under `## Concrete Steps`, the orchestrator MUST
PSI-verify every named class via `mcp-steroid` find-class. Use
`steroid_execute_code` with
`JavaPsiFacade.findClass(fqn, GlobalSearchScope.allScope(project))`.
If the orchestrator only has a short name (e.g., `BTree`), construct
the FQN from package context first — `findClass` returns null on bare
short names.

Pattern-inducing class names from precedent is a known trap: the
V1 → V2/V3 naming pattern often does NOT survive a generic-extraction
refactor. For example, the live v3 single- and multi-value B-tree
lifecycle classes are NOT `CellBTreeSingleValueV3` /
`CellBTreeMultiValueV2` / `SBTreeV2` — they collapsed into a single
generic
`com.jetbrains.youtrackdb.internal.core.storage.index.sbtree.singlevalue.v3.BTree`
that is wrapped twice from
`core/.../index/engine/v1/BTreeMultiValueIndexEngine.java:77,81`.
When the orchestrator infers a class name from sibling-version
conventions, generated-code conventions, or package-naming precedent
rather than reading existing tests or production callers, it MUST
verify the name via PSI before committing it to the track file.

**mcp-steroid state handling.** The session-start hook surfaces one
of three states per conventions.md:any:any `§1.4`:

- **Reachable + cwd matches** → run PSI find-class as above.
- **Reachable + cwd mismatch** (`steroid_list_projects` reports a
  different project from the working tree) → pause and ask the user
  via `AskUserQuestion` to switch the open project before proceeding.
  Do NOT silently fall back to `find` — a PSI query against the wrong
  project produces false negatives that look identical to a true
  hallucination.
- **Unreachable** → fall back to `find . -name '<ClassName>.java'`
  and add a reference-accuracy caveat to the track file's
  `### Clarifications` subsection.

**Failure path.** If PSI-verify reports a name does not resolve and
the track file's four Phase 1 track-level sections
(`## Purpose / Big Picture`, `## Context and Orientation`,
`## Plan of Work`, `## Interfaces and Dependencies`) do not
explicitly mark it as a class this track creates: try once — read the
production code or existing
tests for the named target, derive the canonical name, and re-verify.
If after one retry the name still does not resolve, do NOT write or
commit the track file. Surface the conflict via `AskUserQuestion` with
three options: **Use the verified alternative** (orchestrator proposes
the closest matching name), **Drop the mention** (remove the reference
from the step body), **Escalate to inline replanning**.

This rule applies to non-interactive orchestrator writes (Phase 1
plan write, Phase A decomposition writes, inline-replanning writes,
autonomous strategy-refresh writes). Interactive writes through
review mode (Track Pre-Flight and Track Completion) follow the same
verify mechanism, the same one-retry rule, and the same mcp-steroid
state handling, but surface failures conversationally inline as
the user accumulates observations, and let the final approval
panel carry any `⚠`-warnings that survived past the inline
clarification — see review-mode.md:orchestrator,reviewer-plan,reviewer-dim-track:2,3A,3C
§ Validation for the mapping. The user's Refine / Cancel paths in
review mode cover Use-alternative / Drop / Escalate; Apply with a
warning still attached is the explicit user consent step that
does not exist (and could not exist) in the non-interactive
path.

This rule is the orchestrator-side complement to the sub-agent-side
PSI rule in §Tooling above.

### Track Pre-Flight — Strategy Assessment + Track Summary
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3A summary="The two-panel Pre-Flight gate: a look-back strategy assessment and an upcoming-track summary with a review-mode loop." -->

Before Phase A's reviews and decomposition begin, the orchestrator
runs a single Pre-Flight gate that combines a backward-looking
strategy assessment (when an earlier track has just completed or
been skipped) with a forward-looking summary of the upcoming track.
The gate is the user's chance to refine the plan / track file before
sub-agents start reading them — via free-form review mode (see
review-mode.md:orchestrator,reviewer-plan,reviewer-dim-track:2,3A,3C) for light edits, clarifications,
questions, skipping a remaining track, and combinations thereof —
or to escalate to inline replanning when the change is deep.

The gate fires once per fresh Phase A entry. State C resume (the
track file's four Phase 1 track-level sections
(`## Purpose / Big Picture`, `## Context and Orientation`,
`## Plan of Work`, `## Interfaces and Dependencies`) already carry
the agreed-upon track plan, including any prior clarifications)
**skips** the gate; the user saw it in the original session and the
four sections are already authoritative. The gate is also re-runnable
on session resume (no
review has yet been recorded in `## Outcomes & Retrospective` — see
§Phase A Resume) — the resume idempotency rule at the end of this
section governs that case.

**1. Build Panel 1 — strategy assessment (look-back).**

Skip Panel 1 if there is no completed or skipped track yet (the
very first Phase A entry of the plan) — there is nothing to look
back at.

Otherwise, read the just-completed (or just-skipped) track's
episode plus the accumulated episodes of all earlier completed
tracks, and assess the remaining tracks against discoveries:

- Do any track episodes contradict assumptions in upcoming tracks?
- Has the Component Map changed in ways affecting remaining tracks?
- Are any Decision Records weakened by what was learned?
- Are there new dependencies between tracks not in the original plan?

Produce an assessment — `CONTINUE`, `ADJUST`, or `ESCALATE` —
with a short rationale. The assessment is rendered inline in
Panel 1 of the user-facing summary; nothing is persisted to disk
yet.

If the assessment is `ESCALATE` (accumulated discoveries
fundamentally changed the picture), present Panel 1 alone to the
user using `AskUserQuestion` with two options — **Accept
escalation** and **Override**. On **Accept**, route to
inline-replanning.md:orchestrator:3A,3C immediately and do
NOT render Panel 2. On **Override** (the user disagrees with the
ESCALATE recommendation), fall through to step 2: build Panel 2
and present the full three-option gate in step 3, treating the
overridden assessment as `CONTINUE` for the purpose of step 6's
on-disk strategy-refresh line.

**2. Build Panel 2 — track summary (look-forward).**

Read the plan-file Track N entry (title, intro paragraph, scope
indicators, any inline notes) and the upcoming track's track file's
four Phase 1 track-level sections (`## Purpose / Big Picture`,
`## Context and Orientation`, `## Plan of Work`,
`## Interfaces and Dependencies`) plus any `mermaid` diagram, written
by `create-plan` at Phase 1 and possibly amended by prior Pre-Flight
rounds or inline replanning, including any `### Clarifications`
subsection from a prior gate session. Render the summary inline.

**3. Ask the user.** This step runs only if step 1 did not exit
the gate — i.e., Panel 1 was skipped (no anchor track), Panel 1's
assessment was `CONTINUE` or `ADJUST`, or Panel 1's `ESCALATE` was
overridden. If step 1 routed to inline replanning via `Accept
escalation`, the gate has already exited and this step does not
run.

Render Panel 1 (if active) followed by Panel 2, and use
`AskUserQuestion` with three one-step options per the approval-panel
contract in review-mode.md:orchestrator,reviewer-plan,reviewer-dim-track:2,3A,3C § Approval-panel
contract:

- **Approve** — accept the assessment and proceed to step 6
  (persist) below with whatever clarifications buffer (see step 5)
  and on-disk amendments the review-mode loop has accumulated
  (empty on the first render, populated if earlier rounds applied
  items).
- **Review mode** — enter the conversational refinement loop per
  review-mode.md:orchestrator,reviewer-plan,reviewer-dim-track:2,3A,3C § Flow.

  The user drops observations across as many chat turns as they
  want; the orchestrator silently classifies and accumulates them.
  When the user signals completion, one approval panel surfaces
  the accumulated set. On Apply, the orchestrator executes
  `EDIT_PLAN` / `EDIT_STEP_DESC` items against the plan / step
  files, appends `CLARIFY` items to the in-conversation
  clarifications buffer (step 5 below); `QUESTION` items were
  already answered inline as they came in (no side effect at
  Apply time). `FIX_FINDING` is not available on Pre-Flight (see
  review-mode.md:orchestrator,reviewer-plan,reviewer-dim-track:2,3A,3C § Action types).

  After Apply, return here: re-render Panel 1 (re-running the
  strategy assessment if any `EDIT_PLAN` item touched a remaining
  track, since the touched track may have changed the look-back
  picture) and Panel 2 from the now-updated files; re-ask.
- **ESCALATE** — route to inline replanning per
  inline-replanning.md:orchestrator:3A,3C.

The three-option panel re-renders after every review-mode Apply
until the user picks **Approve** or **ESCALATE**. Step 4 below
defines the light-vs-deep boundary; review mode's classification
and Mixed-set policy enforce it (see
review-mode.md:orchestrator,reviewer-plan,reviewer-dim-track:2,3A,3C § Mixed-set policy).

If an `EDIT_PLAN` reorder during review-mode Apply changes which
track is "next", Panel 2 is rebuilt against the new upcoming track
per track-skip.md:orchestrator:3A step 2's panel-rendering
contract.

**4. Apply amendments — light vs deep boundary.**

Light amendments are applied by review mode's Apply step per
review-mode.md:orchestrator,reviewer-plan,reviewer-dim-track:2,3A,3C § Flow step 5, via `Edit` for
single-site changes or `steroid_apply_patch` when more than two
sites are touched. These are markdown edits, so the project
`CLAUDE.md` "always route file edits through MCP Steroid" rule is
satisfied with native `Edit` for single-site changes here.
Amendments that name production classes in the four Phase 1
track-level sections (`## Purpose / Big Picture`,
`## Context and Orientation`, `## Plan of Work`,
`## Interfaces and Dependencies`) are bound by the §Pre-write rule
above — PSI-verify every named class via `mcp-steroid` find-class
**silently during accumulation, and inline-ask the user if a name
does not resolve** (per review mode § Flow step 1.2), so the user
can correct a pattern-induced name during the same review-mode round
rather than after commit:

- Track title, intro paragraph
- Scope indicators in the plan-file checklist entries
- The four Phase 1 track-level sections (`## Purpose / Big Picture`,
  `## Context and Orientation`, `## Plan of Work`,
  `## Interfaces and Dependencies`) in the track file
- Track-level `mermaid` diagrams in the track file
- Reordering of remaining `[ ]` tracks within the plan checklist
  (only if dependencies still hold; re-render Panel 2 if the
  reorder changes the upcoming track)
- Skipping a remaining track (`SKIP_TRACK` action item — single
  user-initiated drop with a required reason; runs the full
  track-skip.md:orchestrator:3A § Process on Apply, including
  the terminal track-file delete; re-render Panel 1 with the
  skipped track as the new look-back anchor)

Deep amendments — route to inline replanning per
inline-replanning.md:orchestrator:3A,3C (trigger: "user
requests escalation during track pre-flight"):

- Decision Records, Architecture Notes, Goals, or Constraints in
  the plan file
- **Adding** a new track (requires authoring a fresh track file's
  four Phase 1 track-level sections — `## Purpose / Big Picture`,
  `## Context and Orientation`, `## Plan of Work`,
  `## Interfaces and Dependencies` — plus dependency analysis and
  design decisions). **Removing** a remaining track is light — it is
  the `SKIP_TRACK`
  action item above, not a deep amendment.
- Cross-track interaction surfaces (i.e., the change would affect
  another track's scope beyond pure reordering)
- Anything the user describes as "fundamental rework"
- A Panel 1 strategy assessment producing `ESCALATE` that the
  user accepts (handled in step 1 above)

When the gate ESCALATEs, inform the user, restate any captured
clarifications so the user can fold them into the replan if still
relevant, then load `inline-replanning.md` and proceed.

**5. Capture clarifications.** Keep a clarifications buffer in the
orchestrator's conversation context — a bullet list of the user's
notes plus any orchestrator-stated interpretations the user
confirmed. The buffer is non-empty only if at least one `CLARIFY`
item was applied during a review-mode round (see
review-mode.md:orchestrator,reviewer-plan,reviewer-dim-track:2,3A,3C § Flow step 5). When the user
picks **Approve**, the buffer flows verbatim into a
`### Clarifications` subsection appended to the track file's
`## Context and Orientation` section in step 6 below (the four
Phase 1 track-level sections' canonical home for user-supplied
current-state notes per the C&O-as-current-state idiom).

**6. Persist amendments + clarifications + strategy-refresh line.**

After the user picks **Approve**, write the on-disk artifacts of
this round:

- **Strategy-refresh line** (Panel 1 was active): append a
  `**Strategy refresh:**` line to the plan file under the
  just-completed (or just-skipped) track's block, recording the
  assessment outcome — `CONTINUE` or `ADJUST` (with a brief
  summary of what was adjusted). Example for CONTINUE:

  ```markdown
  - [x] Track 2: <title>
    > <intro paragraph>
    >
    > **Track episode:**
    > <strategic summary>
    >
    > **Track file:** `plan/track-2.md` (4 steps, 0 failed)
    >
    > **Strategy refresh:** CONTINUE — no downstream impact detected.
  ```

  Example for ADJUST:

  ```markdown
    > **Strategy refresh:** ADJUST — Track 4 description updated to account
    > for the new `IndexStatistics` API shape discovered during this track.
  ```

  For skipped tracks (`[~]`), the strategy-refresh line follows
  the skip record (see track-skip.md:orchestrator:3A step 5).
  The skip record's `**Skipped:**` line serves as the just-skipped
  track's episode for the purpose of the assessment.

  The line is **not written** when Panel 1 was skipped (very-first
  track — there is no anchor block) or when the gate ESCALATEd
  (inline replanning restructures the plan directly).

- **Clarifications subsection** (buffer non-empty): write the
  buffer as a `### Clarifications` subsection at the end of the
  upcoming track's track file's `## Context and Orientation`
  section (per the Track Pre-Flight design — clarifications are
  current-state user notes that belong with C&O; see
  `conventions-execution.md` §"Section lifecycle").
  **If a `### Clarifications` subsection already exists** (e.g., a prior
  gate session committed clarifications and was interrupted before
  any review ran, then re-fired on resume per §Phase A Resume),
  **delete the existing subsection first and replace it with the
  new buffer** — the gate's output reflects this session's
  decision, not a layered history. Panel 2 already surfaced any
  prior on-disk clarifications in the summary, so anything still
  relevant can be re-stated by the user during the loop. If the
  buffer is empty, skip this edit. An existing
  `### Clarifications` subsection on disk from a prior session is
  preserved as-is in this case (the user neither re-clarified nor
  asked for it to be removed).

- **Plan/track-file amendments** (any `EDIT_PLAN` / `EDIT_STEP_DESC`
  / `SKIP_TRACK` items applied during review-mode rounds): the edits
  already landed in the working tree during review mode's Apply step
  (review-mode.md:orchestrator,reviewer-plan,reviewer-dim-track:2,3A,3C § Flow step 5), including any
  track-file deletions produced by `SKIP_TRACK`. They are committed
  alongside the strategy-refresh line and any clarifications below.

After all artifacts are in place, run a single Workflow update
commit:

```bash
git add docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/implementation-plan.md \
        docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/plan/track-<N>.md
git commit -m "Apply pre-flight amendments before Track <N>"
git push
```

Stage only the files actually edited — drop the path that wasn't
touched. If the round produced no amendments, no clarifications,
and no strategy-refresh line (the gate was a pure no-op — only
possible when Panel 1 was skipped or its outcome was already on
disk from a prior interrupted session, and the user picked
**Approve** without entering review mode), skip this commit
entirely.

**7. Resume idempotency.** If the merged gate is re-entered on a
session resume (no review has been recorded in `## Outcomes &
Retrospective` yet — see §Phase A Resume), the gate checks for a
`**Strategy refresh:**` line under the just-completed/skipped
track's block before running Panel 1. If the line exists, Panel 1
is **skipped** on resume — the earlier session's assessment is the
historical record and is preserved. The Pre-Flight loop runs on
Panel 2 only. Plan/track-file edits committed in the previous
session persist; clarifications captured in the previous session
lived only in conversation context and are lost — the user must
re-enter them if still relevant. (An on-disk `### Clarifications`
subsection committed by the prior session does persist; step 6's
replace-then-write rule governs how it interacts with this
session's buffer.)

**Partial-commit asymmetry.** A prior session may have committed
step 4 plan/track-file edits but died before step 6 wrote the
strategy-refresh line. On resume the line is missing, so the gate
re-runs Panel 1; the committed edits are the new baseline (they
do not appear as a diff against the original plan).

To surface any such prior amendments, the orchestrator MUST run
the following before Panel 1 starts on a resume entry (no review
recorded yet):

```bash
git log --oneline -10 -- docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/implementation-plan.md \
                          docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/plan/track-<N>.md
```

If the output contains a recent `Apply pre-flight amendments
before Track <N>` commit but no corresponding `**Strategy
refresh:**` line is present on disk under the
just-completed/skipped track's block, the prior session's edits
are the new baseline — surface this in Panel 1's user-facing
output so the user does not re-issue them in this round's
review-mode rounds.

**8. Continue.** Move to §What You Do sub-step 1 below.

### What You Do
<!-- roles=orchestrator,decomposer phases=3A summary="The concrete Phase A actions: read the tier, run the selected reviews, decompose into steps, write the track file." -->

> The Track Pre-Flight gate above must clear before sub-step 1 starts.
> On State C resume the gate is skipped (see §Phase A Resume).

> The §Pre-write rule above governs every write below that names a
> production class — apply it before the atomic write in sub-step 5.

1. **Read the plan file** for strategic context (Goals, Architecture
   Notes, Decision Records, Component Map) and the **track file**
   (`docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/plan/track-N.md`) for the track's
   detailed description. The track file already exists from Phase 1
   and may carry pre-flight amendments and a `### Clarifications`
   subsection committed by the gate above; both phases of consumption
   route through the same file.

2. **Read the confirmed tier** (the tier line in
   `implementation-plan.md`) to select which reviews to run (see
   §Tier-driven review selection below).

3. **Run track-scoped reviews** as sub-agents (technical, risk, adversarial
   as warranted). After each review completes:
   - Update the **Outcomes & Retrospective** section in the track file
     with a one-line summary — review type, iteration count at PASS,
     and a brief tally of findings that drove plan/step edits. Prefix
     the entry with the review type so Phase A Resume (and Phase 4
     aggregation) can distinguish Phase A review entries from Phase C
     iteration entries that share the same section:
     `- [x] Technical: PASS at iteration N (M findings, K accepted)`
     (substitute `Risk:` or `Adversarial:` for the other Phase A
     review types). Phase C entries use a distinct prefix
     (`Track-level code review iteration N…` or `Track complete`)
     per the track-completion flow in
     track-code-review.md:orchestrator,reviewer-dim-track:3C §Review loop.
     The Phase A review-iteration row in `§2.1`'s lifecycle table names
     `## Outcomes & Retrospective` as the canonical home for these
     entries; the legacy `## Reviews completed` section no longer
     exists in the 14-section per-track shape.
   - Each strategic panel reviewer writes its findings to a committed
     review file in the
     conventions-execution.md:orchestrator,decomposer,implementer,reviewer-dim-step,reviewer-dim-track,reviewer-plan,reviewer-technical,reviewer-risk,reviewer-adversarial:2,3A,3B,3C,4
     `§2.5` schema (under `_workflow/plan/track-N/reviews/` per the `§2.1`
     review-file lifecycle), so the committed file is the durable record
     of what the review found. What stays off the orchestrator's
     long-lived context is the finding **evidence base**: the
     orchestrator keeps only its partial-fetch of `## Findings` for the
     live iteration loop and never resident-carries the bodies. The
     planning trace the next reviewer iteration and Phase 4 read is the
     resulting track-file edits (decomposition, risk tags, description
     tweaks). Phase A resume still gates on the **Outcomes &
     Retrospective** checkboxes in the track file, not on the review-file
     presence: a checkbox is `[x]` only after the gate for that review
     type has passed, so a completed panel review's findings are already
     consumed into the track-file edits, while an interrupted iteration
     leaves the entry `[ ]` and the next session re-runs that review type
     from iteration 1.
   - **Context consumption check** (mandatory after each review, except
     after the last action of the phase): run
     `cat /tmp/profile-b-code-context-usage-$PPID.txt`. If the level is
     `warning` (≥40%) or `critical` (≥50%), do NOT start the next review
     or decomposition. Save all work and ask the user for a session
     refresh (see `workflow.md` §Context Consumption Check). If the pause
     leaves Phase A mid-flight (for example, technical review PASSed
     but risk / adversarial reviews are still unrun, or all reviews
     PASSed but decomposition has not yet been written), write a
     handoff file per
     mid-phase-handoff.md:orchestrator,planner:0,1,2,3A,3B,3C,4 so the next session
     does not re-spawn reviewers whose results already landed in the
     **Outcomes & Retrospective** section. If the level is `safe`/`info`,
     continue. If the file does not exist or the command fails, this
     is **not an error** — treat as `safe` and continue.
4. **Decompose scope indicators** into concrete steps. For each step,
   assign a **risk tag** (`low` / `medium` / `high`) per the criteria
   in risk-tagging.md:decomposer,orchestrator,implementer:3A,3B,3C — load that file at the
   start of decomposition. The tag controls whether Phase B runs
   step-level dimensional review for the step.
5. **Write decomposed steps** to the track file's `## Concrete Steps`
   section as a numbered roster of thin lines — description + `risk:`
   tag + `[ ]` checkbox per step (per D9; no nested blockquote). Per-
   step episodes do not live here; they live in `## Episodes`, which
   stays empty until Phase B writes its first step block. Before this
   atomic write, apply the §Pre-write rule above to every production
   class named in a step body — PSI-verify each via `mcp-steroid`
   find-class so a pattern-induced name (V1 → V2/V3 trap, generated-
   code package drift) does not slip into the track file and force an
   iter-2 fix round. On unresolved-name failure, follow the **Failure
   path** in §Pre-write rule (one retry, then `AskUserQuestion`) — do
   NOT write the track file with an unresolved reference.

   **Append the Phase A decomposition-complete Progress entry.**
   Follow the D12 canonical statusline-read-then-write order:

   1. Read `/tmp/profile-b-code-context-usage-$PPID.txt` and parse the
      `level=` value. If the file is missing or the parse fails,
      use `unknown` per the D12 fallback rule — do not skip the
      write. Capture the current UTC time as `<ISO>` (format
      `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ`) by running
      `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ`.
   2. Append a single entry to the track file's `## Progress`
      section:
      `- [x] <ISO> [ctx=<level>] Review + decomposition complete`.

   The `[ctx=<level>]` field is mandatory per D12 — see
   `design.md` §"Continuous-log discipline" subsection
   *Mandatory `[ctx=<level>]` field* for the rationale. The same
   read-then-write order applies to every other Progress writer
   (Phase B per-step sub-step 7, Phase C iteration writes, Phase C
   track-completion, the failed-step `[!]` path in
   `step-implementation-recovery.md`).

6. **Commit and push the Phase A workflow updates.** Phase A's on-disk
   writes — the populated `## Concrete Steps` section and the new
   Progress entry — must be committed before Phase B spawns the first
   implementer for this track. The implementer's revert path uses
   `git reset --hard HEAD`, which would otherwise discard the
   uncommitted decomposition.

   ```bash
   git add docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/plan/track-<N>.md
   git commit -m "Phase A review and decomposition for <track>"
   git push
   ```

   This is a single Workflow update commit per the table in
   `commit-conventions.md` § Commit type prefixes. Stage explicit
   paths only — never `git add -A` — so unrelated files in the
   working tree (e.g., scratch logs from prior debugging) don't get
   pulled in.

### Tier-driven review selection and which reviews to run
<!-- roles=orchestrator,decomposer phases=3A summary="Pick the Phase-3A panel by tier, not step count; Risk gated, Adversarial narrowed, minimal Technical-only." -->

The **confirmed tier** (D9), not step count, selects the Phase-3A panel
at the change level. Read the tier line in `implementation-plan.md`. This
replaces the former Simple / Moderate / Complex step-count axis as the
change-level selector. The selection reads **no per-step risk signal**
(S4): the tier is the change-level driver; the per-step `risk:` tag stays
the Phase-3B gate and the Phase-C triage stays the Phase-3C gate, and the
two never stack into one signal. The reviews still determine *which*
pre-execution passes run, not user interaction level: all tracks execute
autonomously after review, all tracks get track-level code review
(Phase C) regardless of tier, and step-level dimensional review (Phase B
sub-step 4) runs only for steps tagged `risk: high` per
risk-tagging.md:decomposer,orchestrator,implementer:3A,3B,3C; `medium` and `low` steps rely on
tests plus track-level review.

| Tier | Phase-3A review pipeline |
|---|---|
| `minimal` | Technical review only — Risk and Adversarial are dropped (a single track is the whole change the research-log gate already vetted). |
| `lite` | Technical (always); Risk track-characteristic-gated (see below); Adversarial narrowed to track realization (see §Track-scoped adversarial review). |
| `full` | Technical (always); Risk track-characteristic-gated (see below); Adversarial narrowed to track realization (see §Track-scoped adversarial review). |

**Risk is track-characteristic-gated in `lite`/`full`.** The Phase-3A Risk
review is a distinct sub-agent from the per-step `risk:` tag that gates
Phase 3B. It runs when the track's characteristics warrant it:

| Tier + track characteristics | Reviews to run |
|---|---|
| `minimal` (any characteristics) | Technical only |
| `lite`/`full`, no warranting characteristic | Technical + Adversarial (narrowed) |
| `lite`/`full` + critical paths or performance constraints | Technical + Risk + Adversarial (narrowed) |
| `lite`/`full` + major architectural decisions | Technical + Risk + Adversarial (narrowed) |

The Risk-gating characteristics are critical paths, performance
constraints, **or major architectural decisions** — the design's Part-6
enumeration deliberately widens Risk to cover architectural decisions
(which today's mapping routed to Adversarial), so the table above is the
target enumeration, not today's mapping. The Adversarial pass runs in
every `lite`/`full` track (narrowed to track realization), so the prior
"major architectural decisions or non-obvious scope → add Adversarial"
upgrade row is subsumed: Adversarial is no longer conditional in
`lite`/`full`.

### Inputs passed to Phase A review sub-agents
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3A summary="The strategic and tactical inputs each Phase A review sub-agent receives (slim plan, track file, diff scope)." -->

All four Phase A review sub-agents — the track-scoped technical, risk,
and adversarial reviews, plus the review gate verification — receive
the same shared set of inputs. The mini-sections below describe only
what each review *does* with those inputs; the inputs themselves are
enumerated here once so the mini-sections can point here by reference
instead of restating them.

| Input | Value |
|---|---|
| `plan_path` | Absolute path to `docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/implementation-plan.md` — the strategic context (Goals, Constraints, Architecture Notes, Decision Records, Component Map). |
| `step_file_path` | Absolute path to `docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/plan/track-N.md` — once Phase A has written the track file, its four Phase 1 track-level sections (`## Purpose / Big Picture`, `## Context and Orientation`, `## Plan of Work`, `## Interfaces and Dependencies`) are the authoritative source for the track's intent / current-state / step-aware-plan / inter-track-boundary content and any track-level diagram (per the lifecycle table in `conventions-execution.md` `§2.1`). |
| `track_name` | The track heading as it appears in the plan file's checklist (e.g., `"Track 2: Execution workflow edits"`). |
| `codebase_path` | Absolute path to the repository root — the sub-agent may Read any file under this path to validate code references. |
| `prior_episodes` | Summary of track episodes from already-completed tracks. The episodes themselves also appear in the slim plan snapshot pointed at by `plan_path`, but they are passed as a **separate** value so each review prompt's `{prior_episodes}` placeholder resolves without forcing the sub-agent to re-parse the plan. Used for cross-track consistency checks. |
| `previous_findings` | Findings from earlier iterations of the same review type (empty on iteration 1; populated on iterations 2–3). Used to avoid re-surfacing already-accepted/deferred findings and to verify that review-fix commits resolved prior findings. |
| `review_file_path` | Absolute path the sub-agent writes its structured output to, in the review-file schema (`conventions-execution.md` `§2.5`). The orchestrator points it at `docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/plan/track-N/reviews/<type>-iter<N>.md` — the `§2.1` lifecycle home — where `<type>` is the review type (`technical` / `risk` / `adversarial`, or the per-type gate-verification form `<review_type>-gate-verification`, i.e. `technical-gate-verification` / `risk-gate-verification` / `adversarial-gate-verification`) and `<N>` is the iteration, so each fan-out unit writes a distinct file. The gate-verification filename is parameterized by `<review_type>` so the three per-type gate-verifications in one iteration do not collide on a single name. The sub-agent `mkdir -p`s the `reviews/` directory and writes the file in file-when-handed-a-path mode (see each prompt's output-mode block); the develop-state run that supplies no path falls back to today's inline output. |

Phase A orchestration always passes both `plan_path` and
`step_file_path` to each sub-agent. Prompts that read the track
description from the plan-file entry use `plan_path`; prompts that
read it from the track file's four Phase 1 track-level sections
(`## Purpose / Big Picture`, `## Context and Orientation`,
`## Plan of Work`, `## Interfaces and Dependencies`) use
`step_file_path`. The Inputs block and the per-review mini-sections
below do not need to change when an individual prompt switches sources
— only the prompt file itself is edited.

**Output routing — the orchestrator partial-fetches `## Findings`.**
Because each panel reviewer now writes its findings to the committed
`review_file_path` file rather than returning them inline, the
orchestrator reads them back with a partial fetch of the file's
`## Findings` section (the `§2.5` schema's body) rather than receiving
the bodies in its conversation context. The reviewer's thin return is
the manifest only. Before trusting the manifest index, the orchestrator
validates the manifest `findings` count against `grep -cE '^### [A-Z]+[0-9]+ '`
(the `§2.5` S4 check); on a `CONTRACT_VIOLATION` flag or a count
mismatch it falls back to a whole-section read of the file rather than
the partial-fetch (the orchestrator/planner owns the strategic
fallback per `§2.5`). This is the strategic side of the routing split:
the orchestrator still ingests `## Findings` (its consumer is the
planner revising the track file, not an implementer), so it keeps the
partial-fetch — the on-disk win is the evidence base (`## Evidence
base`) staying off-context, not the findings themselves. The output
path is what wires the producer prompts' file-when-handed-a-path
branch to a caller; without it the reviewers would emit inline and the
orchestrator would have nothing on disk to fetch.

**Gate-verification-specific inputs.** The review gate verification
sub-agent additionally receives `findings` (the current iteration's
findings under re-check — semantically distinct from `previous_findings`,
which carries finalised findings from earlier iterations) and a
`review_type` value identifying which review produced the findings
(`technical` / `risk` / `adversarial`). These two are not part of the
shared set because the track-scoped reviews do not consume them; the
gate-verification mini-section below notes their role. The
gate-verification spawn also receives its own `review_file_path` from
the shared set above, pointed at the per-type
`<review_type>-gate-verification-iter<N>.md` slot for its re-check pass
(e.g. `technical-gate-verification-iter2.md`), so the technical, risk,
and adversarial gate-verifications in one iteration each write a
distinct file. The gate-verification then writes the verdict-producer
manifest variant (`§2.5`), which the orchestrator partial-fetches the
same way; only its
*new* findings live under `## Findings`, while the per-prior-finding
`VERIFIED` / `STILL OPEN` / `REJECTED` verdicts ride the manifest's
`verdicts` block.

### Track-scoped technical review
<!-- roles=reviewer-technical phases=3A summary="The track-scoped technical review and its prompt file." -->

Spawn a sub-agent with the technical review prompt. Inputs: the shared
set defined in §Inputs passed to Phase A review sub-agents above.

**Prompt file:** prompts/technical-review.md:reviewer-technical:3A

### Track-scoped risk review
<!-- roles=reviewer-risk phases=3A summary="The track-scoped risk review and its prompt file." -->

Spawn a sub-agent with the risk review prompt. Inputs: the shared set
defined in §Inputs passed to Phase A review sub-agents above.

**Prompt file:** prompts/risk-review.md:reviewer-risk:3A

### Track-scoped adversarial review
<!-- roles=reviewer-adversarial phases=3A summary="The narrowed track-realization adversarial pass, its track-1 episode-challenge drop, and the D14 tier model/effort pin." -->

Spawn a sub-agent with the adversarial review prompt. Inputs: the
shared set defined in §Inputs passed to Phase A review sub-agents
above. Runs in `lite` and `full` only (`minimal` drops it).

**Narrowed to track realization (D9).** A track's inline decisions are
already vetted by the Phase-0→1 research-log adversarial gate, so this
pass does **not** re-challenge those decisions. It focuses on track
realization along three challenges:

- **Scope and sizing** — is the track's file footprint and step
  decomposition right?
- **Cross-track-episode reality** — do the realized outputs earlier tracks
  hand to this one actually exist as the track assumes?
- **Invariant violation** — does any step's plan violate a plan invariant?

**Track-1 exception.** On the first track of a multi-track plan, only the
**cross-track-episode** challenge is dropped (there is no prior episode to
challenge). The **scope/sizing** and **invariant-violation** challenges
still run on track 1 — the foundational track's sizing and invariants
most constrain every downstream track, so a whole-pass skip would exempt
exactly the track most worth challenging. (This is why the pass is not
dropped wholesale on track 1; only the one challenge that needs a prior
episode is.)

**Model and effort pin (D14).** Pin the Agent `model` field by tier on the
spawn: `full` → Fable 5, `lite` → Opus 4.x. Both are intended to run at
xhigh effort; the Agent surface exposes no per-spawn effort field and
there is no adversarial-reviewer agent file to carry it in frontmatter, so
the xhigh-effort half rides the session default. Do not attempt to set a
per-spawn effort field: none exists, and the spawn carries only the
`model` field. That is D14's documented
degradation caveat — neither the model pin landing via the `model` field
nor the effort pin degrading to the session default reopens the decision.

**Prompt file:** prompts/adversarial-review.md:reviewer-adversarial:3A

### Review gate verification
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3A summary="Re-run the Phase A reviews against applied fixes via the review-gate-verification prompt." -->

After fixes are applied, spawn a sub-agent to verify. Inputs: the
shared set defined in §Inputs passed to Phase A review sub-agents
above, **plus** the gate-verification-specific `findings` (the
iteration's findings under re-check) and `review_type`
(`technical` / `risk` / `adversarial`).

**Prompt file:** prompts/review-gate-verification.md:orchestrator:3A

### Review iteration protocol
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3A summary="Phase A reviews follow the shared review iteration protocol (max 3 iterations, cumulative IDs)." -->

Max 3 iterations per review type, findings cumulative. Full iteration
limits, finding ID prefixes, finding format, and gate verification output
are in review-iteration.md:orchestrator,reviewer-plan,reviewer-dim-step,reviewer-dim-track:2,3A,3B,3C — load that file when
running the review loop. If blockers persist after 3 iterations, note them
and proceed with caution — the step implementation phase will surface
concrete issues if they exist.

### Step Decomposition
<!-- roles=decomposer phases=3A summary="Decompose the track into a roster of risk-tagged steps; sizing, cross-cutting, and parallel-annotation rules." -->

After track review passes, decompose scope indicators into concrete steps.
Decompose **all steps at once** — a track is sized by its in-scope file
footprint, bounded above by the soft ceiling (the two-sided sizing rule in
`planning.md` §Track descriptions), so the whole step roster is small enough
to decompose up front. Step count is not the track-sizing metric; it falls
out of the footprint once Phase A fills steps toward the per-step target
below.

#### Inputs for decomposition

- Track description, scope indicators, component diagram, and relevant
  Decision Records
- Track episodes from all completed tracks
- Codebase knowledge gained from track review

#### Decomposition rules

- Each step = one commit.
- Each step = fully tested, self-contained change with 85% line / 70%
  branch coverage.
- **Coherence (mandatory for `high`, preferred for `low`/`medium`).**
  For `high` steps coherence is mandatory: a `high` step is one
  coherent, logically continuous change, and if it does unrelated
  things, split it. For `low`/`medium` steps coherence is a preference,
  not a wall: the decomposer may merge several changes, related or not,
  into one step to reach the fill target below. The mandatory split
  rules are high-isolation (next bullet) and the `~14`-edited-files
  overblown line (the Fill bullet below); coherence alone forces a
  split only at `high`, and file count alone never forces a split.
- **High-risk isolation.** Put each HIGH-category change in its own
  `high`-tagged step, sized by the change itself with no file cap — a
  HIGH change that legitimately spans many files stays one step so its
  step-level dimensional review sees the whole change at once.
- **Fill ordinary steps toward ~12 edited files.** For `low`/`medium`
  steps, decompose toward the *largest* change that stays within ~12
  edited files, not the smallest, merging available `low`/`medium`
  work (related or not) into one step to reach the target. This is a
  directive, not a permission: collapsing k small steps into one
  removes (k-1) cold-read re-pays, and the measured implementer-context
  ceiling for steps at this footprint sits well below the warning band.
  Flag a `low`/`medium` step at ~14+ edited files as overblown and
  split it. Carve-out: prefer splitting when the work is likely to need
  heavy per-step iteration (debugging-prone or test-churny), since
  iteration count, not edited-file count, is the measured context
  driver.
  - **Overlap-aware merge ordering.** When several `low`/`medium` units
    are available to merge, prefer the one overlapping the step's
    current file set: it adds fewer files to the ~12 budget, so more
    change fits before a new step (a new implementer) is needed, and it
    removes a future re-read of the shared file. A step holding `Foo`
    and `Bar` that pulls in a unit touching `Foo` and `Baz` adds only
    `Baz`; pulling in one touching `Qux` and `Quux` adds two files and
    removes no re-read. This orders which mergeable unit to pull in
    first; it does not relax the fill target or the closed under-fill
    set below.
  - **Step adjacency is not a merge.** Two distinct steps each spawn
    their own implementer, and Phase C reads the whole track diff
    regardless of step order, so ordering two unmergeable steps next to
    each other removes no implementer invocation — the dominant per-step
    cost. The one modest step-level adjacency gain is the orchestrator
    briefing the next implementer from its just-built knowledge of a
    shared file. State this plainly so the rule does not drift into a
    false "make steps adjacent" token claim: at the step level, only a
    merge removes an implementer.
  - **Under-fill justification.** A `low`/`medium` step whose planned
    footprint still lands below the ~12 fill target must carry an
    inline `— size: ~N files; <reason>` clause on its `## Concrete
    Steps` roster line naming why it is not maximized. The reason is
    drawn from a closed set of two: **(a) no mergeable `low`/`medium`
    work fits**: the rest of the track is `high`, it is the end of the
    track, or the only remaining `low`/`medium` unit is a single
    coherent change large enough that merging it would trip the `~14`
    overblown line; or **(b) heavy-iteration carve-out**: the
    debugging-prone or test-churny work above, kept small on purpose.
    "Unrelated to the rest of the track" is **not** a valid reason:
    under the relaxed coherence rule unrelated `low`/`medium` work is
    merged, so "unrelated" can only signal that the step should have
    absorbed more, so merge more rather than justify. "An inter-step
    dependency forces sequencing" is **not** valid either: interdependent
    `low`/`medium` steps are merged into one with the dependency
    becoming intra-step ordering. A step at or near ~12 is maximized and
    carries no clause.
- If a step feels trivial (single import, single rename), merge it into
  a neighbor.
- Note **cross-cutting concerns** (shared types, refactors) as separate
  steps rather than embedding them inside feature steps.

#### Risk tagging

Assign a risk tag — `low`, `medium`, or `high` — to each decomposed
step. The tag controls whether Phase B runs step-level dimensional
review (`high` runs the full review loop; `medium` and `low` skip it
and rely on tests plus track-level review). Track-level review at
Phase C always runs against the cumulative track diff regardless of
the per-step distribution.

Apply the criteria in risk-tagging.md:decomposer,orchestrator,implementer:3A,3B,3C — load that
file at the start of decomposition. Seven HIGH categories (concurrency,
crash-safety/durability, public API, security, architecture,
performance hot path, workflow machinery), one MEDIUM band (multi-file
logic, test infrastructure, build config, observability changes,
bounded behavioral workflow edits), and a LOW default for refactoring /
new tests / docs / isolated bug fixes / prose-only workflow edits. When
in doubt, mark `high` — over-tagging costs an extra review, but
missing a real high-risk step ships bugs.

Write the tag inline on each step's `## Concrete Steps` roster line
(per D9 — thin numbered lines, no nested blockquote):

```markdown
1. <description> — risk: <level> (<category, "default", or "override: <reason>">)  [ ]
2. <description> — risk: low (default) — size: ~N files; <closed-set reason>  [ ]
```

The optional `— size: ~N files; <reason>` clause is present only when
an under-filled `low`/`medium` step triggers it (see the Under-fill
justification rule under §"Decomposition rules" above); a maximized
step omits it.

The tag stays in place through Phase B (where it gates
`step-implementation.md` sub-step 4) and Phase C (where `medium` and
`high` are treated as focal points by the track-level reviewers).
Once a step is implemented, the tag is locked.

#### Parallel step annotation

During decomposition, you may identify independent steps within the
track — steps that don't depend on each other and don't modify the same
files. Annotate them with `*(parallel with Step N.M)*` in the track file.
Must not modify the same files.

#### Output

Write decomposed steps to the **track file**
(`docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/plan/track-N.md`), creating it if it doesn't exist.
Scope indicators in the plan file are NOT replaced — step details live only
in the track file.

The scope indicators serve as a starting point, not a binding contract. You
may produce more or fewer steps than the indicator suggested, or cover
different aspects, based on what is actually needed.

### Phase A Resume
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3A summary="Resume Phase A mid-stream by reading recorded reviews and the decomposition state from the track file." -->

The track file already exists from Phase 1 with the four Phase 1
track-level sections (`## Purpose / Big Picture`,
`## Context and Orientation`, `## Plan of Work`,
`## Interfaces and Dependencies`) populated, so Phase A resume's
only concerns are (1) what state the
Track Pre-Flight gate left behind and (2) which Phase A activities
have completed. When `/execute-tracks` auto-resumes into Phase A
(the Startup Protocol's State C `Review + decomposition is [ ]` row
routes here), the main agent applies the rules below.

**Track Pre-Flight gate.** The gate re-fires on resume only when no
review has been recorded in the track file's `## Outcomes & Retrospective`
section yet. Once any review has been recorded, the gate's outcome
(amendments + clarifications) is baked into the track file the
reviews ran against — re-firing would invalidate that work. The
re-fired gate honours the resume idempotency rule in §Track
Pre-Flight step 7: if a `**Strategy refresh:**` line is already on
disk under the just-completed/skipped track's block, Panel 1 is
skipped and only Panel 2 is presented. Clarifications captured in
the prior session lived only in the orchestrator's conversation
context and are lost; the re-fired gate sees committed amendments
on disk (an on-disk `### Clarifications` subsection persists and
interacts with this round's buffer per §Track Pre-Flight step 6's
replace-then-write rule), but the user must re-enter any
clarifications they had given previously.

**Uncommitted gate state.** Before re-firing the gate, run
`git status --porcelain docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/implementation-plan.md docs/adr/<dir-name>/_workflow/plan/track-<N>.md`. If either path is
dirty, the previous session was interrupted between applying
amendments and committing them. Surface the diff to the user and ask
whether to keep or revert the uncommitted changes before continuing —
silently committing them would smuggle un-reviewed edits into the
gate's audit trail, and silently reverting them would lose user-
approved amendments.

**Resume actions** (after the gate has cleared, or skipped because
reviews are already in progress):

| `## Outcomes & Retrospective` state | `## Concrete Steps` state | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Empty (no `Technical:` / `Risk:` / `Adversarial:` prefixed entries) | Empty | Re-fire the gate (per the rules above), then run §What You Do sub-steps 1-6 from the top. |
| One or more `Technical:` / `Risk:` / `Adversarial:` entries recorded as `[x]` | Empty | Skip the gate. Resume reviews from the next missing review type (§What You Do sub-step 3 onward). |
| All planned `Technical:` / `Risk:` / `Adversarial:` entries recorded | Non-empty `[ ]` items | Skip the gate. Decomposition has run; resume from sub-step 6 (commit) if not yet committed, otherwise the track file is already in steady state and `/execute-tracks` should route to Phase B on the next invocation. |

Pattern-match on the entry prefix (`Technical:` / `Risk:` /
`Adversarial:`) to filter out Phase C iteration entries
(`Track-level code review iteration…` / `Track complete`) that share
the same section. Phase A only inspects its own review-type entries.

The non-re-copy rule (no operation re-derives the four Phase 1
track-level sections — `## Purpose / Big Picture`,
`## Context and Orientation`, `## Plan of Work`,
`## Interfaces and Dependencies` — from external sources during
Phase A) protects any amendments / inline-replan rewrites the track
file may have accumulated since Phase 1 from being silently
overwritten on resume.

---

## Phase A Completion — MANDATORY SESSION BOUNDARY
<!-- roles=orchestrator phases=3A summary="Phase A ends the session after the atomic track-file write; the next session begins Phase B." -->

> **Do NOT proceed to Phase B in the same session.** Phase A always ends
> with a session boundary. The user clears context and re-runs
> `/execute-tracks` to begin Phase B with fresh context.

After writing the track file with all decomposed steps:

1. **Verify the track file** on disk has:
   - `Review + decomposition` marked `[x]` in Progress
   - All reviews recorded in Outcomes & Retrospective
   - All steps listed as `[ ]` items
2. **Verify the Phase A commit landed.** Run `git status --porcelain`;
   the working tree must be clean. Run `git log -1 --oneline` and
   confirm the tip is `Phase A review and decomposition for <track>`.
   If the commit is missing (e.g., the session was interrupted
   between step 5 and step 6 of §What You Do), run step 6 now —
   the implementer's `git reset --hard HEAD` would otherwise
   discard the decomposition.
3. **Inform the user** that Phase A is complete:
   - How many steps were decomposed
   - Which reviews were run and key findings
   - Any concerns or risks noted during review
   - Instruct: "Clear session and re-run `/execute-tracks` to start
     Phase B (step implementation)."
4. **Run self-improvement reflection.** Load
   `.profile-b/workflow/self-improvement-reflection.md` on-demand and
   follow it. Phase A friction worth recording typically lives in
   the review-iteration loop, the technical/risk/adversarial sub-agent
   prompts, the decomposition rules, or the track-file template. The
   protocol creates approved proposals as YouTrack issues under
   `YTDB` with the `dev-workflow` tag (or skips with a notice if
   the YouTrack MCP server is unreachable); reflection produces no
   commit. Then proceed to Step 5.
5. **End the session.** Do not proceed to Phase B in the same session.

**Why:** Phase A is exploratory (reading code, validating assumptions).
That "reviewer mindset" context is not helpful during implementation —
it dilutes focus and carries stale exploratory context. The track file
bridges everything the implementation phase needs.
