"""Per-worktree token-usage telemetry for the Phase 4 ADR.

Computes a *percentages-only* snapshot of where this worktree's Claude
Code session context went, broken down by tool, plus a top-files table
for the Read tool. The output is a Markdown ``## Token usage telemetry``
section ready to embed verbatim in ``adr.md``.

Why percentages-only: the published ADR ships in a
public repository. Absolute token counts are non-comparable across
worktrees of different durations and carry no information the
percentage split doesn't, so the script never prints them. The only
absolute values in the output are the session count and transcript-file
count, both metadata about *how much* was measured rather than per-bucket
content.

Scope and detection
--------------------
The script measures ``~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/**/*.jsonl``
recursively. Sub-agent transcripts live under
``<transcript-stem>/subagents/`` and account for the majority of jsonl
files on most worktrees, so a non-recursive glob would silently
under-count. ``<encoded-cwd>`` is the cwd with ``/`` replaced by ``-``;
the cwd is canonicalised via ``Path.cwd().resolve()`` first so symlinked
worktree roots map to the right encoded folder, falling back to the raw
``Path.cwd()`` encoding when the resolved-path folder is missing.

Worktree-vs-main detection routes through the ``.git`` file-vs-directory
shape (documented by ``gitrepository-layout(5)`` and stable across git
versions), not ``git worktree list`` ordering:

  * ``.git`` is a **file** (linked worktree) -> measure.
  * ``.git`` is a **directory** (main checkout) -> emit the
    main-checkout skip notice, exit 0.
  * ``.git`` is **missing** (not in a checkout) -> emit the no-checkout
    skip notice, exit 0.

Measurement methodology
-----------------------
For each jsonl transcript: read every line as JSON; build a
``tool_use_id -> (tool_name, file_path)`` index from ``assistant``
records' ``tool_use`` content blocks; then classify every content block
against the index and tally an approximate token count (char-count / 4,
the standard heuristic shared with ``session-stats.py`` and ``ccusage``)
into one of six buckets. Records are deduped by ``uuid`` so a record that
appears in both an orchestrator transcript and a sub-agent transcript is
counted once. The ``(message.id, requestId)`` key ``session-stats.py``
uses is assistant-only and absent on ``tool_result`` records, so it is
deliberately *not* reused here.

Rendering discipline: the full Markdown section is buffered in memory and
printed atomically on success. On a parse failure mid-walk the script
emits a skip notice naming the offending file and exits 0, so the ADR
commit still succeeds rather than failing on a corrupt transcript line.
