# Workflow startup precheck: one JSON blob describing branch divergence,
# workflow-SHA drift, pending handoffs, and the resume state, so the agent
# parses facts instead of re-deriving them from the startup gate prose.
#
# The artifact walk this script implements is specified by
# conventions.md § 1.6 "Workflow-SHA stamps on _workflow/** artifacts" —
# specifically § 1.6(h) "Phase 1 walk bash block" (the enumerate-and-classify
# walk) and the canonical parser idioms in § 1.6(a1) (the anchored
# 'workflow-sha: <40-hex>' value-extraction regex). conventions.md § 1.6 is
# the single source of truth; this script is one implementation of that spec.
# A source-conformance test asserts the script's walk stays byte-faithful to
# the § 1.6(h) block (the walk lands in a later step of this track).
#
# Usage:
#   workflow-startup-precheck.sh --mode {full,divergence-only,migrate-range} \
#       [--bootstrap-sha <40-char-sha>] [--exclude-sha <sha> ...]
#
# Modes:
#   full              Full startup detection: {divergence, drift, handoffs,
#                     state, actions_taken}.
#   divergence-only   A cheap mid-session re-check: {divergence, actions_taken}.
#   migrate-range     The migration stamp-fold range and per-artifact pairs.
#
# --bootstrap-sha applies only to migrate-range (folded into the range when
# supplied). --exclude-sha also applies only to migrate-range and is
# repeatable: each value names a stamp SHA to drop from the merge-base fold
# input, so a stamp on a pruned or unreachable commit cannot re-produce a
# merge-base failure on a --bootstrap-sha re-invocation (the /migrate-workflow
# skill's agent-side recovery drives this). The script emits JSON to stdout and
# never prompts, never force-pushes, and never resets — those mutations stay
# agent-side and user-gated (the no-prompt invariant: no mode reads stdin or
# asks the user).
#
# No global `set -e`: matching statusline-command.sh and the byte-source
# detection blocks, the detection paths rely on defensive `|| true` rather
# than errexit, so the empty-handoff and no-divergence paths cannot abort the
# script mid-walk. `jq` (v1.8.1) is present and required; there is no jq-free
# JSON emitter.

#   git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...'@{u}'           # ahead<TAB>behind
#
# The upstream check runs first so a branch with no upstream skips cleanly
# without attempting the fetch. `git fetch` (no argument) targets the
# upstream's remote, which is not always `origin`. `git rev-list
# --left-right --count HEAD...'@{u}'` prints `<ahead>\t<behind>`
# (tab-separated). The branch has diverged iff BOTH counts are non-zero —
# `git status -sb` does not emit the literal word `diverged`, so the prose
# does not grep for it and neither does this script.
#
# The two guards map to the two skip reasons the prose calls out:
#   * upstream absent  -> skipped=true, skip_reason="no-upstream", detected=false
#   * fetch fails      -> skipped=true, skip_reason="fetch-failed", detected=false
# Both are normal, expected states (no upstream configured; offline). The

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Workflow-SHA drift detection — Phase 1 (artifact walk + classification) and
# Phase 2 (pairwise merge-base fold + `git log`).
#
# Byte-source: conventions.md § 1.6(h) "Phase 1 walk bash block" (the
# enumerate-and-classify walk) and the anchored value-extraction regex in
# § 1.6(a1) for Phase 1; workflow-drift-check.md § Detection for the Phase 2
# fold (the `break`-on-first-failure shape) and the `git log` range. The drift
# check (workflow-drift-check.md § Detection) and the /migrate-workflow skill
# both byte-copy the same § 1.6(h) Phase-1 block, so this script's walk must
# stay byte-faithful to it; a source-extraction conformance test (see tests/)
# asserts the glob set and regex match the canonical block.
#
# Phase 1 classifies each active-plan _workflow/** artifact as stamped (a
# line-1 `<!-- workflow-sha: <40-hex> -->` comment present) or unstamped, and
# records the two sets in plain shell variables. Phase 2 consumes the all-
# stamped set, folds it pairwise through `git merge-base` to derive BASE_SHA
# (conventions.md § 1.6(c)), then runs `git log $BASE_SHA..HEAD` against the
# workflow pathspecs to populate base_sha / commit_count / first_commits.
#
# § 1.6(h) resolves the active plan dir per § 1.6(g): the dir is
# `docs/adr/<dir-name>` where `<dir-name>` is the current git branch name. The
# byte-source block carries the literal `PLAN_DIR="docs/adr/<dir-name>"` line
# with `<dir-name>` as a placeholder downstream writers replace at invocation
# time; this script resolves it from the branch. The branch resolution is the
# one line that legitimately differs from the byte-source placeholder (the
# § 1.6(h) prose states the placeholder is substituted at invocation), so the
# conformance test compares the walk's glob set and regex, not the PLAN_DIR
# assignment.
#
# Three Phase-1 outcomes (matching workflow-drift-check.md § Detection):
#   * both sets empty   -> no stampable artifact on disk; silent no-drift
#                          (detected=false, kind=null, scalars null).
#   * any unstamped     -> drift detected unconditionally; kind="unstamped",
#                          fold scalars null (no fold runs for an unstamped set;
#                          the bootstrap prompt covers it agent-side per
#                          § 1.6(d)).
#   * all stamped       -> Phase 2: fold the stamp set pairwise through
#                          `git merge-base` to derive BASE_SHA, then run
#                          `git log $BASE_SHA..HEAD` on the workflow pathspecs.
#                          A non-empty `git log` is drift (detected=true,
#                          kind="stamped", base_sha / commit_count /
#                          first_commits filled); an empty `git log` is no drift
#                          (detected=false, kind="stamped", base_sha filled,
#                          commit_count=0, first_commits=[]). A merge-base
#                          failure during the fold short-circuits to
#                          kind="merge-base-failed" with null fold scalars (the
#                          § 1.6(c) recovery prompt stays agent-side).

# Shared pairwise merge-base fold (conventions.md § 1.6(c)).
#
# Folds a stamp set pairwise through `git merge-base` to derive BASE_SHA, the

# handle a merge-base failure (a stamp on a git-gc-pruned commit, or two stamps
# with no reachable common ancestor in the local repo), so the loop is
# single-sourced here and parameterized by that one axis:
#
#   * "break"    (full / drift-check, workflow-drift-check.md § Detection):
#                the gate has no recovery prompt to amortise, so it records the
#                first failing pair and stops folding.
#   * "continue" (migrate-range, migrate-workflow/SKILL.md Step 2): the
#                migration's bootstrap re-prompt is user-interactive, so the
#                fold collects EVERY failing pair into one batch before exiting.
#
# Inputs (positional): $1 = failure mode ("break" | "continue"); $2.. = the
# stamp set to fold (each a 40-hex SHA).
# Outputs (script-scoped, the caller reads them after the call):
#   * FOLD_BASE_SHA           — the folded BASE_SHA, or "" when a failure
#                               reset it (break mode leaves "" on failure;

#                               value, which the caller discards when

# No-drift normalization — the script's only autonomous mutation.
#
# Byte-source: workflow-drift-check.md § No-drift normalization. Fires only on
# the no-drift path (empty `git log` range) AND when the stamp set carries more
# than one distinct SHA — the active plan's stamps fold to the same BASE_SHA yet
# sit on different commits on disk. Rewriting every artifact's line-1 stamp to
# BASE_SHA collapses the next gate's fold input to a single-element set, keeping
# the gate O(1) on subsequent runs. The fold result the byte-source names
# $BASE_SHA is the script's $DRIFT_BASE_SHA, passed in as $1; the byte-source's
# bare $BASE_SHA would expand empty under this script's no-`set -u` posture and
# rewrite every stamp blank, so binding it to the resolved fold result is the
# one variable adaptation the move into a function forces.
#
# All-or-nothing contract: either every stamp moves to BASE_SHA in one commit,
# or the on-disk state is unchanged. Two diff-shape guards enforce it. The
# rewrite is in place (printf + tail, never staged) until both guards pass;
# `git checkout --` alone restores the tree on mismatch (nothing is staged yet),
# so the "stamps rewritten without a commit" in-between state is unreachable
# under correct invocation.
#
# Args: $1 = the folded BASE_SHA (the script's DRIFT_BASE_SHA); $2 = the active
# plan dir (PLAN_DIR, the same value detect_drift resolved from the branch).
#
# Control-flow adaptation vs the byte-source: the byte-source ends the success
# path with a terminal `exit 0`. This function instead `return`s on success so
# the caller flows into emit_json and the `full`-mode JSON still emits with
# drift.normalization_landed and actions_taken reflecting the commit. The abort
# path keeps the byte-source's hard `exit 1` (a non-zero exit that halts the
# calling session) — that asymmetry, success-`return` vs abort-`exit 1`, is the
# second sanctioned adaptation. On success the function sets
# DRIFT_NORMALIZATION_LANDED=true and replaces ACTIONS_TAKEN_JSON's empty `[]`
# with a one-element array naming the commit (action label, short SHA, subject),
# so emit_json reports the mutation in the `full`-mode JSON.
#
# Path-quoting assumption (byte-source): all `_workflow/**` artifact names are
# fixed-template (implementation-plan.md, design.md, design-mechanics.md,
# track-<digits>.md) with no shell metacharacters, so the unquoted expansion of
# $stamped_files below is safe. A future artifact name carrying spaces or

# migrate-range detection — the artifact walk and stamp-fold the /migrate-workflow
# skill's Step 2 needs, emitted as data the skill reads instead of re-deriving
# the walk in prose.
#
# Byte-source: migrate-workflow/SKILL.md Step 2. The walk is byte-copied from
# conventions.md § 1.6(h) but extended with the one sanctioned § 1.6(h)
# extension — a paired `(file, sha)` array (`STAMPED_PAIRS`, one `$f=$SHA` entry
# per stamped artifact) so a merge-base failure can name the failing artifact
# PATH, not a bare SHA, in the skill's recovery re-prompt. The drift walk above
# never re-prompts on a failing pair, so it omits the pairing; this is why the
# § 1.6(h) source-conformance test scopes its "no STAMPED_PAIRS" assertion to
# the drift walk and treats the pairing here as the whitelisted extension.
#
# The fold reuses the shared fold_stamps_to_base function (the same one the
# drift Phase 2 fold uses) with the "continue" failure mode — distinct from the
# drift gate's "break" mode. The migration's bootstrap re-prompt is user-
# interactive, so the fold continues past every merge-base failure to collect
# the FULL failing set into one batch (FOLD_FAILED_PAIRS), letting the skill
# cover the combined unstamped + merge-base-failed set in one re-prompt. The
# break-shape would re-prompt once per failing pair encountered serially. The
# single shared fold parameterized by this one axis keeps the in-script fold
# single-sourced the way conventions.md § 1.6(h) single-sources the prose walk.
#
# The fold input set is $STAMPED_SHAS plus the optional --bootstrap-sha when the
# skill supplies one (after the user provides a base SHA for the unstamped set);
# absent, the fold runs over $STAMPED_SHAS alone (migrate-workflow/SKILL.md
# Step 2's FOLD_INPUT shape). The script never prompts: an unstamped set with no
# --bootstrap-sha is reported in unstamped_files and the skill drives the prompt
# agent-side, then re-invokes with the validated SHA (the no-prompt invariant:
# no mode reads stdin or asks the user).
#
# detect_migrate_range writes plain shell variables only; the single emit point
# below assembles the migrate-range object from them.
#
# Outputs (script-scoped, consumed by emit_json's migrate-range branch):
#   * MR_STAMPED_PAIRS_JSON  — `[{file, sha}, ...]` for each stamped artifact.
#   * MR_UNSTAMPED_JSON       — `[<path>, ...]` for each unstamped artifact.

#                               or one or more merge-base failures).
#   * MR_LOG_RANGE_JSON       — `[{sha, subject}, ...]` for the BASE_SHA..HEAD

#                               merge-base pair, `files` naming the artifact

# table). The top-level precedence is:

#   * State 0 first — an absent plan file, an absent `## Plan Review` section,
#     or a `## Plan Review` first top-level checkbox still `[ ]` means plan
#     review has not passed. Checked before any track walk.
#   * Otherwise walk `## Checklist` for the first `[ ]` track. A track file
#     present at `plan/track-N.md` is State C (mid-track resume); absent is
#     State A (pre-Phase-A — the rare path, since /create-plan writes every
#     track file at Phase 1 and the only track-file-deleting action leaves the
#     track `[~]`, not `[ ]`).
#   * Every track `[x]`/`[~]` — read `## Final Artifacts`' first top-level
#     checkbox: `[ ]`/`[>]` is State D (Phase 4), `[x]` is Done.
#
# The top-level walk resolves State 0/A/C/D/Done. For State C the walk computes
# the sub-state from the active track file's `## Progress` continuous log and
# `## Concrete Steps` roster (the joint read below); the section-discrepancy
# edge — a roster step flipped `[x]` with no matching Progress entry — lands in a
# later step of this track, so the `section-discrepancy` literal is not yet
# emitted here. STATE_JSON is the `{phase, substate}` object the emit point
# splices into `full`-mode output via --argjson (the track's Interfaces
# contract); divergence/drift/handoffs are unaffected.
#
# The five State C sub-states (the strings emitted in state.substate) and their
# sources, mirroring workflow.md § Startup Protocol step 5's sub-state table:
#

#                                       entry is `[ ]` (Phase A not yet done).

#                                       quantified, so the still-empty/placeholder
#                                       `## Concrete Steps` roster is never coerced
#                                       to an all-steps-done shape.
#   * "failed-step"                  — the `## Concrete Steps` roster carries a
#                                       `[!]` step (a failed step). Checked before
#                                       steps-partial so a roster that is both
#                                       failed and partial routes to the failed
#                                       resume, matching the workflow.md `[!]` row.
#   * "steps-partial"                — the roster has at least one `[ ]` step (and

# only sub-state 1 is a pure `## Progress` read. The slug strings above are the
# track's Interfaces contract; design.md's frozen example glosses them with the
# longer workflow.md row text (a Phase-4 design-final reconciliation).
#
# The markers read are the conventions.md § 1.2 § Status markers set
# (`[ ]` / `[x]` / `[~]` / `[>]`) plus the roster/Progress `[!]` failed-step
# marker (step-implementation-recovery.md) that § 1.2's table omits but a later
# step's State C failed-step sub-state depends on. `[!]` is recognized, not an
# error. The enum stays closed: an unrecognized glyph (`[X]`, `[ x]`, `[]`,
# etc.) on a checkbox line the parser reads is an explicit parse error on
# stderr with a non-zero exit, before any `state` is emitted — never silently
# coerced into a state. Because determine_state runs in the main shell (no
# subshell), the parse_error `exit` terminates the script before emit_json, so
# the malformed-marker path emits no JSON on stdout.
#
# determine_state sets STATE_JSON (a compact JSON object) directly rather than
# writing scalars for a *_json assembler, because the object is small and the
# phase/substate shape is self-contained; the single emit point still owns
# splicing it into the mode output.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Output of determine_state, consumed by emit_json's full branch. Defaults to

# the first `[...]` on the line — it is the checkbox AFTER the `risk:` token. The
# scan therefore splits each roster line at the last `risk:` and reads the

# (the only roster mutation is the status flip `[ ]`→`[x]`/`[!]` plus the

# jq makes quoting and escaping correct by construction, but emitting JSON
# null for an absent scalar is NOT automatic: the naive `--arg x "$VAR"` form
# binds an empty shell variable to the JSON empty string "", never null. Each
# nullable scalar therefore uses the explicit
#   ($x | if . == "" then null else . end)
# idiom, and counts add `... else tonumber end` so a present count emits a JSON
# number rather than a quoted string. This is the load-bearing emit surface for
# the behavior-parity contract: downstream `jq -e '.field == null'` assertions
# distinguish a genuinely-absent scalar from an empty string, and parity with
# the prose this script replaces depends on null, not "".
