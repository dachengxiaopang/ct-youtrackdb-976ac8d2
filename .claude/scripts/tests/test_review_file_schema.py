"""Mechanical test for the review-file count-validation contract (S4/S6).

The review-file schema in `.claude/workflow/conventions-execution.md` §2.5
("Review-file schema, count validation, and coverage") defines two
mechanical invariants over every bulk-producing sub-agent's output file:

  S4 (count validation): the manifest `findings` count must equal the
      ID-anchored grep count over the file. On a mismatch the reader
      raises CONTRACT_VIOLATION and falls back to a whole-section read.
  S6 (heading-only validation): the count is taken from heading lines
      only, never a finding body, so a reader validates without ingesting
      any body and the no-bodies invariant holds through validation.

The canonical count-validation regex (the single source of truth lives in
conventions-execution.md §2.5) is:

    grep -cE '^### [A-Z]+[0-9]+ '

`[A-Z]+` (one-or-more uppercase), NOT `[A-Z]{2,}`, so single-letter
strategic prefixes (`T`/`R`/`A`/`S`) match alongside two-letter dimensional
ones (`BC`/`CQ`/…). The trailing space after `[0-9]+` excludes the
four-hash `#### <cert>` evidence entries.

This script is the validation: it implements the §2.5 reader's
count-validation logic (`validate_review_file`) using the canonical regex,
then asserts the four fixtures behave per the per-step acceptance criteria
in the track file's `## Validation and Acceptance`:

  1. A valid two-letter-prefix dimensional file validates (count == manifest).
  2. A valid single-letter-prefix strategic file (`### T1 `) validates —
     the case that motivated `[A-Z]+` over `[A-Z]{2,}`.
  3. A count-mismatch file raises CONTRACT_VIOLATION.
  4. A file with a stray `### CASE1 ` body heading raises
     CONTRACT_VIOLATION (the file-wide reservation: a stray uppercase
     three-hash heading anywhere inflates the count).

It also asserts the regex-source contract: every fixture embeds and
cites the canonical regex literal, and the regex this script runs is
byte-identical to the literal the schema documents.

Invocation (from repo root):

    python3 .claude/scripts/tests/test_review_file_schema.py

Exit code 0: every assertion passed. Exit code 1: one or more failed;
each failure prints to stderr.
