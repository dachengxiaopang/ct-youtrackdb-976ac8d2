"""Validation runner for the `dsc-ai-tell` rule in
`.claude/scripts/design-mechanical-checks.py`.

Running this script is the validation: it shells out to
`design-mechanical-checks.py` against the seeded fixture and the three
calibration ADRs, parses each JSON output, and asserts:

1. The fixture exercises every banned pattern — each pattern in
   `PATTERN_SIGNATURES` below has at least one `dsc-ai-tell` finding.
2. The fixture's negative-case paragraphs (hyphenated technical
   compounds, single em-dash, the eight genuine subject-led contrasts
   the trailing-negation "X, not just Y" rule must not fire on, the
   concrete named mechanisms the inflated-abstraction-label rule must
   not fire on, and the H1 Title Case heading) emit zero `dsc-ai-tell`
   findings.
3. The Overview enabling-primitive sentence (line 25) emits zero
   inflated-abstraction-label findings — the `## Overview` section is
   skipped because naming "the enabling primitive(s)" is the prescribed
   Overview element there.
4. The three calibration ADRs (`persist-visible-count`, `index-gc`,
   `non-durable-wow`) each emit zero `dsc-ai-tell` findings — the
   zero-false-positive contract the rule was calibrated against.

Invocation (from repo root):

    python3 .claude/scripts/tests/test_dsc_ai_tell.py

Exit code 0: every assertion passed. Exit code 1: one or more failed;
each failure prints to stderr.

Manifest — `dsc-ai-tell` baseline counts on existing ADRs at the time
this runner was authored (informational; the runner does not fail on
these). Survey across `docs/adr/*/adr.md` excluding the three
calibration ADRs:

    docs/adr/thin-workflow/adr.md           6
    docs/adr/unit-test-coverage/adr.md      1
    docs/adr/ytdb-817-new-track-format/adr.md  5

Total 12 findings across 7 non-calibration ADRs. These are real signals
the rule should keep firing on; if a future change drives any of them to
zero unintentionally, the rule has been weakened. The three calibration
ADRs (`persist-visible-count`, `index-gc`, `non-durable-wow`) hold at
zero — the rule's zero-false-positive contract on those three files is
the contract this runner enforces.
