"""Validation runner for `.claude/scripts/workflow-startup-precheck.sh`.

Running this script is the validation: it shells out to the bash precheck
script, parses the JSON it prints, and asserts the scaffold contract that
this track's first step establishes:

  * the unknown-/missing-mode error path — exits non-zero, prints usage to
    stderr, and emits NO JSON on stdout;
  * the three valid `--mode` shapes (`full`, `divergence-only`,
    `migrate-range`) each emit valid JSON, exit 0, and carry the pinned key
    set with `actions_taken` an empty array and (for `full`) `state` as JSON
    null;
  * the jq null-vs-empty contract on a synthetic nullable scalar: an absent
    `--bootstrap-sha` must emit `base_sha` as JSON `null` (not the empty
    string ""), while a supplied SHA emits the SHA string — the load-bearing
    emit-surface guarantee, for the behavior-parity contract, that every
    later detection field also relies on.

Later changes (divergence, drift, handoff scan, reduced-mode detail) extend
the script and add their own fixtures and assertions; this file pins the
scaffold so a regression in the mode dispatch or the emit idiom fails the
suite immediately.

Invocation (from repo root):

    python3 .claude/scripts/tests/test_workflow_startup_precheck.py

Exit code 0: every test case passed. Exit code 1: one or more failed; each
failure prints a clear message naming the test case.

Runner shape mirrors `.claude/scripts/tests/test_session_stats.py` and
`.claude/scripts/tests/test_measure_read_share.py` (stand-alone, no pytest
collection, exit-code semantics, single file). Pytest is not installed on the
project's CI image; the stand-alone runner keeps the test executable on any
Python 3 host. The harness shells out to the bash script rather than importing
it.

# Reusable git-fixture builder.
#
# The existing `.claude/scripts/tests/` suite is fixture-file-only and carries
# no git-fixture infrastructure, so this builder is new scaffolding. It stands
# up a throwaway git repo under a temp dir and exposes the small surface the
# precheck's git-reading detection needs to exercise its branches:
#
#   * commit()             — author a commit on the current branch.
#   * add_bare_remote()    — create a local `file://` bare remote and push the
#                            current branch to it, leaving the working repo
#                            with an upstream tracking ref (clean / in-sync).
#   * advance_remote()     — push a new commit to the bare remote through a
#                            sibling clone, so the working repo falls behind.
#   * commit() after that  — advance local past the fork point, producing the
#                            both-non-zero divergence the precheck must detect.
#   * break_remote()       — repoint the remote URL at a nonexistent path so
#                            `git fetch` fails while `@{u}` still resolves
#                            (the fetch-failed skip path).
#   * orphan_branch()      — start an unrelated history with no common
#                            ancestor (reserved for the later merge-base-failed
#                            drift fixtures; harmless here).
#
# A `file://` bare remote is used (not a bare path) so the precheck's
# `git fetch` (no argument) reaches a real, fetchable remote — the divergence
# byte-source idiom fetches the upstream's remote before counting ahead/behind.
# Every helper routes git's own stdout/stderr to DEVNULL so progress lines
# never confuse a failure trace; only the precheck's JSON is asserted on.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# No-drift normalization — the script's only autonomous mutation.
#
# Byte-source: workflow-drift-check.md § No-drift normalization. The path fires
# on the no-drift read (empty `git log` range) when the stamp set folds to one
# BASE_SHA but carries more than one distinct SHA (stamps on different commits).
# It rewrites every artifact's line-1 stamp to BASE_SHA, verifies two diff-shape
# guards, and lands one commit; on a guard mismatch it restores the tree and
# exits non-zero with no commit.
#
# The fixtures stamp two artifacts at two distinct *real* commits on the same
# linear history (head_sha captured at two points), so the pairwise fold derives
# the older commit as BASE_SHA and the range is empty — the exact multi-SHA
# no-drift precondition. Each `full` run also carries the divergence half, so an
# upstream is added to keep the fetch from reaching the runner's real remote.
#
# Six behaviors, mirroring the track-level acceptance lines:
#   * success         — one commit (subject `Normalize workflow-sha stamps to
#                       <short>`), line-1-only diff, both stamps at BASE_SHA,
#                       valid five-key `full` JSON on stdout, exit 0,
#                       normalization_landed=true.
#   * uniform skip    — a single distinct SHA (both stamps at the same commit)
#                       fires no normalization: no commit, normalization_landed
#                       false.
#   * guard-1 abort   — a pre-existing line-2+ body edit makes the post-rewrite
#                       diff span past line 1: exit non-zero, the off-line-1 hunk
#                       named on stderr, tree at HEAD, no commit, no JSON.
#   * guard-2 abort   — a dirty non-stamped file inside the plan's `_workflow/`:
#                       exit non-zero, the unexpected path named on stderr, tree
#                       at HEAD, no commit, no JSON.
#   * narrow no-abort — a dirty file OUTSIDE `_workflow/` does not abort; the
#                       normalization still lands.
#   * mode no-mutate  — `divergence-only` and `migrate-range` never call the
#                       normalization (detect_drift runs in `full` only), so a
#                       multi-SHA fixture stays unmutated under those modes.
