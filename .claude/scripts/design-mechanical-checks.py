"""Mechanical checks for design.md mutation discipline.

Implements the structural rules listed in
`.claude/workflow/design-document-rules.md § Mutation discipline § Mechanical
checks (always run)` plus the `dsc-ai-tell` rule that detects the
regex-expressible subset of `house-style.md` AI-tell patterns. Invoked by
the `edit-design` skill after each edit to `design.md` or
`design-mechanics.md`.

D11 (YTDB-1083 reconciliation) renamed the per-section trailing footer from
`### References` to `### Decisions & invariants`. Footer detection is
backward-compatible — both spellings are accepted (FOOTER_HEADING_RE), so a
pre-rename design keeps passing. D11 also adds the
`decision-cited-without-rationale` check: a `D<n>` cited bare under
`D-records:` whose full record is introduced nowhere in design.md is a
`should-fix`. Both are design.md-only — track files carry records in
`## Decision Log` and have no footer.

Usage:
    python3 .claude/scripts/design-mechanical-checks.py \
        --design-path docs/adr/<dir>/_workflow/design.md \
        [--design-mechanics-path docs/adr/<dir>/_workflow/design-mechanics.md] \
        [--plan-path docs/adr/<dir>/_workflow/implementation-plan.md] \
        [--plan-dir docs/adr/<dir>/_workflow/plan/] \
        [--changed-section "Section Title"] \
        [--target design|mechanics|both] \
        [--scope bounded|whole-doc]

For Phase 4 the design path is `docs/adr/<dir>/design-final.md`
(top-level, outside `_workflow/`); see edit-design/SKILL.md for the
phase4-creation kind.

Output: JSON to stdout. Exit code 0 on PASS, 1 on NEEDS REVISION (any blocker).

# Inflated-abstraction label in the SUBJECT slot. Fires on a sentence whose

# `house-style.md § Banned analysis patterns` — e.g. "The enabling primitive
# is …", "The key abstraction here …", "The underlying mechanism …", "The
# driving force is …", "The defining characteristic is …".
#
# The inflation-adjective slot is a CURATED CLOSED SET, not an open
# participle wildcard. A bare `[a-z]+ing` / `[a-z]+ed` arm crossed with the
# concrete label-nouns below ("mechanism", "property", "concept", "factor",
# "force") fires on ordinary concrete-mechanism prose a storage-engine design
# routinely carries — "The locking mechanism is held by the writer.", "The
# hashing mechanism provides O(1)." — none of which is the inflation tell. So
# only the words that actually signal inflation are listed: the participles
# (`enabling`, `driving`, `defining`, `unifying`, `guiding`, `governing`,
# `underpinning`, `animating`) plus the inflated adjectives (`key`, `core`,
# `central`, `underlying`, …). A concrete participle like `locking` / `hashing`
# / `polling` is deliberately absent and therefore passes.
#
# Two discriminators keep it off the design-doc Overview's sanctioned use.
# `design-document-rules.md § Overview` prescribes naming "the enabling
# primitive(s)" as Overview element 3 — so the caller SKIPS the `## Overview`
# section for this pattern (the only on-branch match, design.md:23 "The
# enabling primitives are the `## Orientation` rule text …", is exactly that
# sanctioned enumeration prose). Beyond that, the capital `The` at a
# sentence/clause start spares lowercase quoted mentions of the labels (a
# rule that quotes "the enabling primitive" as an example is not itself
# using it as a subject), and requiring a finite verb after the label spares
# the bolded enumeration form `**The enabling primitive(s)** —` (em dash, no

# recognized. `&` is matched literally; `&amp;`-style HTML entities are not
# expected in authored Markdown footers.

# footer now references these two regexes so the two spellings never drift

    that make up the paragraph (no trailing blank).

    Each top-level bullet item (a line starting with `- `, `* `, `+ `, or

      Citations there legitimately mention banned vocabulary or hyphenated
      compounds without being a violation.
    - `exclude_tables=True` (default) drops every line whose first
      non-whitespace character is `|`. Table rows often encode terms,
      definitions, and citations that would false-fire the vocabulary scan.
