"""Mechanical reindex + validation tool for workflow-doc TOC regions.

This script is the schema validator and TOC rebuilder for the
per-section role/phase annotation system defined in
`.claude/workflow/conventions.md §1.8`. It runs in two modes:

- `--check` — validate every in-scope workflow doc against the schema
  and exit nonzero on findings. Used by the pre-commit hook and CI.
- `--write` — rebuild every TOC region in place from the current
  annotations and auto-stamp every in-file `§X.Y(z)` reference with
  the target heading's roles/phases suffix. Halts atomically with
  exit 2 if any in-file ref is unresolved (write nothing, anywhere);
  idempotent (second invocation produces no diff). Does NOT touch
  cross-file `name.md:roles:phases` suffixes (hand-written per D9).

Both modes share file enumeration, heading/annotation parsing, TOC
region detection, and the CommonMark fence + inline-backtick state
machine that excludes pedagogical refs inside code spans from
validation and rewriting.

Validation rules. The eight rules per design.md §"Reindex script" →
§"Validation rules":

1. Stamp present on line 1 (`<!-- workflow-sha: <40-char SHA> -->`).
2. Exactly one TOC region under H1 (empty TOC accepted for files
   without `^## ` headings).
3. TOC matches annotations: every `^## ` and `^### ` heading has a
   TOC row (bootstrap-block heading exempt by literal-text match).
4. Annotation present after every `^## ` and `^### ` heading (same
   bootstrap exemption).
5. Annotation fields well-formed: `roles=`, `phases=`,
   `summary="..."` ≤120 chars, no spaces around commas, every token
   drawn from the bootstrap output (15 roles + 8 phases including
   the `any` wildcard).
6. Cross-file `name.md[§X.Y(z)]:roles:phases` refs carry the suffix
   and the citer's slice is a subset of the target's annotation per
   §1.8(e). `any`-wildcard semantics: `target.roles={any}` matches
   any citer role; `citer.roles={any}` requires `target.roles={any}`.
   Refs inside fenced code blocks and inline backtick spans are
   excluded.
7. Bootstrap block present on the 38 in-scope system prompts (7
   SKILL.md, 11 prompts, 20 agents) — literal heading match
   `## Reading workflow files (TOC protocol)`.
8. In-file `§X.Y` / `§X.Y(z)` refs auto-stamped with the target
   heading's roles/phases suffix; unstamped, stale, and unresolved
   refs all fail. Same fenced + inline-backtick exclusion as rule 6.

Bootstrap path. The role and phase enums are not hard-coded in this
script — they live in `.claude/workflow/conventions.md §1.8`. The
script discovers the §1.8 source at startup:

1. Enumerate `docs/adr/*/_workflow/staged-workflow/.claude/workflow/conventions.md`.
   Multiple matches halt with exit 2 (ambiguous bootstrap probe).
   A single match wins per `conventions.md §1.7(d)` reads-precedence.
2. Otherwise fall back to live `.claude/workflow/conventions.md`.

This staged-aware probe extends the §1.7(d) reads-precedence rule to
script invocations — without it, the script would always read the
live file and miss the schema changes that a workflow-modifying
branch has staged but not yet promoted.

CLI surface. `--check` runs every applicable rule against the
in-scope file set (or a subset via `--files`) and exits with code
0 (clean), 1 (findings), or 2 (script error or ambiguous bootstrap
probe). `--files <paths>` scopes validation to the listed files —
out-of-scope paths are silently skipped per design.md §"Reindex
script" → §"Validation rules" (the pre-commit hook's regex is
broader than the in-scope glob, so this skip is load-bearing for
mixed-content commits). `--write` computes the full plan in memory
across the in-scope set, halts with exit 2 on the first unresolved
in-file ref (writing nothing), and applies the mutations to disk
only when every file resolves cleanly.

# so workflow-modifying branches catch staged edits before they land
# in history; the script's discovery walk has to enumerate the same

    r"""Per-line inline-code-span column ranges, with spans that cross line breaks.

    `inline_backtick_spans` is line-local: it matches an opening backtick run
    against a closing run *on the same line* and leaves an unclosed run as
    literal text. But a CommonMark code span can span line breaks — a backtick
    run opens a span that the next equal-length run closes wherever it falls,
    including on a later line, with interior line breaks treated as ordinary
    characters. A line-local scan miscounts when a span straddles a newline: on
    the line carrying the *closer*, the closing run reads as an *opener*,
    flipping backtick parity for the rest of that line and pushing
    genuinely-backticked refs outside any detected span. That is the rule-6 /
    rule-8 false positive (a backticked ref wrongly flagged), and symmetrically
    a false negative (a real un-backticked violation wrongly skipped when the
    flip pulls it "inside" a phantom span).

    The fix processes each maximal run of consecutive non-reset lines as one
    block: concatenate the block with its `\n` separators (so column offsets
    line up), run the existing `inline_backtick_spans` primitive over the whole
    block text, then map each resulting span back onto the lines it overlaps.

    `reset_lines[i]` marks a line that interrupts inline parsing and so resets
    the span carry (the line itself gets an empty span list). The caller passes
    the block-level structures an inline code span cannot sit inside: fenced
    code blocks always, plus the TOC table region when `parse_file` builds the
    mask (`_span_reset_mask`). Resetting at the TOC region stops a stray
    backtick in a Summary cell from pairing with one in the prose below and
    swallowing a real ref. An opening run with no equal-length closer anywhere
    in the block produces no span — the primitive already leaves it literal —
    so a stray unbalanced backtick cannot swallow the rest of the block.

    Returns a list aligned 1:1 with `lines`; entry `i` holds the `(start, end)`
    column ranges (0-based, end exclusive, delimiter backticks included) of the
    code spans overlapping line `i`.

# on files the schema exempts. Rule 4 alone would emit ~360 false findings
# across the 20 agents (every un-annotated `##`/`###` heading) versus rule
# 2's 20.

# Instead agents enter a SEPARATE citing scope that runs only rule 6

      SKILL.md is never named bare in a cross-file ref (it would be

      `SKILL.md` key the loop still records (all skill files collide on
      it) stays first-match-wins and is never a valid cross-file target.

    Staged-copy precedence. The reads-precedence rule in `conventions.md`
    §1.7(d) — staged copy authoritative when present, established for the
    §1.8 enum bootstrap probe — extends here to cross-file-ref target
    resolution. On a workflow-modifying branch the in-scope
    set contains both the un-annotated live copy of a target and its
    annotated staged copy under
    `docs/adr/<dir>/_workflow/staged-workflow/.claude/...`. A converted
    cross-file ref must subset-validate against the branch's authored
    annotation, which is the staged copy — so when a live copy and a
    staged copy of the SAME logical target resolve to a key, the staged
    copy wins. On a non-workflow-modifying branch (develop, or a branch
    with no staged subtree) no staged copy exists and the lookup stays
    pure-live, so behaviour is unchanged.

    Keys are derived from each file's logical `.claude/...` path (staged
    prefix stripped), so a staged prompt and its live namesake both
    contribute the `prompts/<basename>` key — keying on the raw staged
    path would have hidden the `prompts/` form for staged prompts.

    Multi-staged ambiguity guard. The guard fires only on a genuine
    duplicate: two staged copies of ONE logical target (two plan dirs each
    carrying a staged-workflow subtree of the same `.claude/...` path). In
    that case the script cannot tell which annotation a converted ref
    should validate against, so it halts with
    `AmbiguousBootstrapProbeError` (CLI exit 2) — the same guard the §1.8
    enum bootstrap probe uses for a duplicated staged `conventions.md`.

    Distinct targets that happen to share a basename are NOT a duplicate.
    Several in-scope files collide on a bare-basename key: all seven
    `SKILL.md` anchors key to bare `SKILL.md`, and the workflow-root
    `structural-review.md` and its `prompts/structural-review.md` namesake
    both key to bare `structural-review.md`. These collisions occur on the
    live side too, where the live globs yield more than one file per such
    key. They are resolved by first-match-wins (the first candidate
    recorded for the key keeps it), not rejected. The guard distinguishes
    the two cases by the recorded winner's logical `.claude/...` path: a
    second staged copy halts only when its logical path equals the recorded
    winner's logical path (the genuine "one target, two plan dirs" case);
    otherwise it is a distinct target sharing a key and the first-match-wins
    entry stands. For every basename that is a valid bare cross-file ref
    target (`conventions.md`, `step-implementation.md`, and the like), the
    globs yield at most one file per key, so the first-match-wins clause is
    a no-op there.

    Workflow-root precedence on the bare key (§1.8(e) basename
    collision). One basename collision has a defined winner rather than
    first-match-wins: when a `.claude/workflow/` root doc and a
    `.claude/workflow/prompts/` prompt share a basename
    (`structural-review.md` today), the bare key resolves to the
    workflow-root doc and the prompt is reachable only through its
    `prompts/<name>` key. A prompt therefore claims the bare key only when
    no workflow-root namesake exists (so a prompts-only basename keeps its
    bare key and existing bare prompt refs still resolve), while a
    workflow-root doc claims the bare key unconditionally — regardless of
    parse order, since the glob sorts the prompts path first. SKILL.md
    collisions are untouched: SKILL.md is never a bare cross-file ref
    target and no workflow-root SKILL.md exists, so the override never
    fires for them and they stay first-match-wins. The override is scoped
    to the bare-basename key; the `prompts/<name>` key is unaffected.

    """Rule 1: line 1 carries the workflow-SHA stamp.

    After the staged-mirror exemption below, rule 1 has no reachable
    in-scope target. This is not obvious from `IN_SCOPE_GLOBS` alone:

    - This script's `IN_SCOPE_GLOBS` mix live-path globs
      (`.claude/workflow/**`, `.claude/skills/**`) with staged-workflow-
      mirror globs (`docs/adr/*/_workflow/staged-workflow/.claude/...`).
    - The `docs/adr/` early-return below discards every live path before
      the stamp check, so the only in-scope paths that could reach the
      check are the staged-workflow mirror.
    - The staged mirror is a byte-verbatim copy of the unstamped live
      file per conventions.md §1.7(e), and §1.6(f) excludes staged copies
      from the stamped artifact set. So those copies correctly carry no
      stamp, and the exemption below skips them.

    Nothing else in `IN_SCOPE_GLOBS` is `docs/adr/`-rooted, so after the
    exemption no in-scope path reaches the stamp check via
    `validate` / `--check`. Rule 1 is kept as a harmless guard: if a
    future change re-introduces a non-exempt `docs/adr/`-rooted glob into
    `IN_SCOPE_GLOBS`, this check would resume firing on it.

    The §1.6(f) stamped artifact set (the `_workflow/**` plan
    artifacts) is enforced elsewhere, by the
    `workflow-startup-precheck.sh` drift gate. That set is DISJOINT from
    this script's `IN_SCOPE_GLOBS` (the drift gate does not re-check
    rule 1's staged-mirror target, and this script does not re-check the
    drift gate's stamped set), so rule 1 neither duplicates nor depends
    on the drift gate's enforcement.

    The empty-file and malformed-stamp branches below stay covered by a

# `--write` mode: TOC region rebuild + in-file ref auto-stamp.
#

#
# 1. The TOC region between the delimiter comments is regenerated from
#    the file's current annotations. One row per `^## ` / `^### `
#    heading in document order; the bootstrap-block heading is exempt
#    per rule 3 / §1.8(c). A file without delimiter comments is a
#    no-op for the TOC half — `--write` does NOT inject a TOC into a
#    file that never had one (the universal annotation rollout owns
#    first-touch delimiter placement).
# 2. Every in-file `§X.Y[(z)][:roles:phases]` ref is rewritten to
#    carry the target heading's current annotation as its suffix. The
#    rewrite skips fenced code blocks and inline backtick spans per
#    §1.8(e). It also skips refs inside the TOC region (those are
#    TOC anchors, not in-prose refs — they get rebuilt by the TOC
#    half above).
#
# Atomicity. `compute_write_plan` runs in two passes: it parses every
# in-scope file and computes the proposed mutations, raising
# `UnresolvedInFileRefError` on the first unresolved in-file ref. The
# CLI converts that exception to exit 2 with no disk writes anywhere.
# Only when every file resolves cleanly does `apply_write_plan` push
# the new content to disk. This matches the "halt-on-unresolved"
# contract from design.md §"Reindex script" → §"--write mode".
#
# Idempotence. The TOC rebuild is deterministic from the headings +
# annotations; running `--write` twice produces the same TOC body
# both times. In-file ref rewrites land the target's current
# annotation; a second pass observes the freshly-stamped ref already
# matching the target and emits no change. The CLI exits 0 in both
# cases (clean run; mutations applied OR no mutations needed).
