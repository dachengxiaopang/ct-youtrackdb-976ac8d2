# Session Prompt — Copy and paste this to start each session

```
Read the plan at .profile-b/plans/errorprone-warnings-fix-plan-all.md, find the first unchecked (- [ ]) step, and execute it. Follow the per-step workflow exactly:

1. Fix all instances of the warning for that step (code fix or @SuppressWarnings as indicated)
2. Elevate the check to ERROR: add `-Xep:<CheckName>:ERROR` to `errorprone.args` in root pom.xml
3. Verify: `./mvnw clean compile -DskipTests` — compilation must succeed with 0 errors for that check
4. Launch a code-reviewer sub-agent to review the changes — iterate fixes until the reviewer is satisfied
5. Mark the checkbox in the plan file (- [ ] → - [x])
6. Commit both the code fix and the updated plan file with message: `Fix ErrorProne <CheckName> warnings`
7. Stop and wait — the next step will be done in a new session

If all steps show checked (- [x]), report that the plan is complete.
