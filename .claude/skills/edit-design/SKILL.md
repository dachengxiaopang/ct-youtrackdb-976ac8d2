## Reading workflow files (TOC protocol)

When you Read any file under `.profile-b/workflow/` or `.profile-b/skills/`, follow the protocol in `conventions.md §1.8`:

1. Read the TOC region: from `<!--Document index start-->` to `<!--Document index end-->` (read to the closing delimiter, not a fixed line count). If the file has no TOC region (a file whose only `## ` heading is this bootstrap block carries none, per `§1.8(d)`), read the file in full.
2. Match TOC rows where Roles contains any of your roles (or your role is `any`, or the row's Roles is `any`) AND Phases contains any of your phases (or your phase is `any`, or the row's Phases is `any`).
3. Use `Read(offset, limit)` to read only matched sections; if no row matches your role/phase, the file holds nothing for you — do not read further.

Your role: orchestrator, planner, or final-designer (whichever invoked this skill).
Your phase: determined by the auto-resume State in `workflow.md` § Startup Protocol.

Inline refs you find inside workflow files carry the same `name:roles:phases` suffix; apply file-level filtering before opening: a ref matches when any of your roles is in its roles and any of your phases is in its phases, your own `any` on either axis matches every ref on that axis, and a ref whose own roles or phases is `any` matches you. Backtick-wrapped refs carry no suffix; open or skip them at your discretion.

<!--Document index end-->

Apply an edit to `design.md` (or `design-mechanics.md`) through the **mutation
discipline** defined in `.profile-b/workflow/design-document-rules.md`. The skill
bundles `(apply edit → auto-review → bounded iterate → present)` into one
atomic action so the structural rules are self-enforcing.

> **Stamp discipline.** `design.md` and `design-mechanics.md` carry a line-1 `<!-- workflow-sha: <40-char SHA> -->` stamp written at creation only: by this skill on the `phase1-creation` and `length-trigger-crossing` kinds, or by `/create-plan`'s planning-transition step when it seeds `design.md` directly. Every other mutation kind (`content-edit`, `section-add`, `section-remove`, `section-rename`, `section-move`, `structural-rewrite`, `mechanics-edit`, `design-sync`) leaves the stamp untouched and preserves its line-1 position; only creation, migration replay, and no-drift normalization write the stamp. The prepend is performed via `Edit`/`Write` against the now-existing file, not a shell redirect. `design-mutations.md` is deliberately excluded from stamping (see the review-log append step for the rationale). Phase 4 final artifacts (`design-final.md`, `design-mechanics-final.md`) are not stamped either; they survive the merge into `develop` where per-branch migration never applies. Format definition, parser idioms, and the paired SHA-computation idiom that the `phase1-creation` and `length-trigger-crossing` kinds copy verbatim are anchored in conventions.md:orchestrator,planner,final-designer:1,3A,3C,4 `§1.6`. Read that section for the single source of truth.

**You MUST use this skill — not raw `Edit`/`Write` — for every modification to
`design.md` / `design-mechanics.md` and for every Phase 4 creation of
`design-final.md` / `design-mechanics-final.md`.** That includes initial
creation in Phase 1 (`phase1-creation`), interactive iteration ("add a
section about X"), and Phase 4 production of the final committed artifacts
(`phase4-creation`). The design is frozen after Phase 1 (`design-document-rules.md`
Rule 15), so Phase 3 inline replanning never invokes this skill — replan design
intent is recorded in the plan's Decision Records and the track narrative
instead (see inline-replanning.md:orchestrator:3A,3C § Process).

## Two operational modes
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="Working mode edits the polished design; sync mode re-distills it from the mechanics companion." -->

The skill supports two complementary workflows. Pick by where you are in
the plan lifecycle:

- **Working / sync** (Phase 1 and large iterative revisions): mutation
  kinds `phase1-creation`, `mechanics-edit`, `design-sync`. `design.md`
  stays frozen between syncs as a stable reference; cold-read is deferred
  to sync.
- **Direct mutation** (small post-publication edits): mutation kinds
  `content-edit`, `section-add`, `section-remove`, `section-rename`,
  `section-move`, `structural-rewrite`, `length-trigger-crossing`. Full
  discipline runs on every mutation.

**Phase 4 special case.** Phase 4 produces `design-final.md` (and
`design-mechanics-final.md` if the original had a mechanics companion).
Use the `phase4-creation` kind — structurally similar to
`phase1-creation` (one-shot creation, full discipline; one or both
files depending on whether a mechanics companion is needed) but
targeting the `*-final.md` paths and skipping plan / track-file ref
propagation (those refs point at the original `design.md`, not at the
new final artifact). No follow-up `mechanics-edit` / `design-sync` cycle:
Phase 4 is committed once.

Full rationale, sub-phase diagram, and sync-trigger rules live in
`design-document-rules.md § Two-mode editing — working vs sync`.

## Skill inputs
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="The mutation kind, target file(s), and edit payload the skill consumes on each invocation." -->

The invoking agent supplies these when calling the skill:

| Input | What it carries |
|---|---|
| `design_path` | Absolute path to `design.md` (or `design-final.md` in Phase 4). |
| `design_mechanics_path` | Absolute path to `design-mechanics.md` (or `null` if no companion). |
| `plan_path` | Absolute path to `implementation-plan.md` (for `**Full design**` link resolution). |
| `plan_dir` | Absolute path to the `plan/` directory containing every `plan/track-N.md` track file (same purpose — each track file's `## Decision Log` may carry `**Full design**` references that the cross-file ref check has to resolve). |
| `target` | `design`, `mechanics`, or `both` — the file(s) the edit touches. Threaded through to the script's `--target` flag verbatim. (No `.md` suffix — the script's argparse choices are `design`/`mechanics`/`both`.) |
| `intended_edit` | Either `(old_string, new_string)` for a focused edit, or full new content for a section-add / section-rewrite / file creation. |
| `mutation_kind` | One of the values listed in the mode table above. |
| `changed_section` | Title of the section being changed (for bounded cold-read scope). For `section-rename`, supply the **new** name. Optional for `mechanics-edit` and `design-sync`. |
| `iteration_budget` | Default `3` — max number of (apply → review) rounds. |

If any required input is missing, **ask the user before proceeding.** The
mutation discipline depends on the agent stating the mutation kind explicitly
so the cold-read scope and check-set are correct; do not guess.

## Cold-read scope and check-set by mutation kind
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="The per-mutation-kind table mapping each kind to its target files, cold-read scope, and mechanical check set." -->

The `--target` column reads as a function of whether
`design-mechanics.md` exists at the time of the mutation. When a value
is written `design \| both`, resolve to `design` if the mutation
touches only `design.md` (the common case for small designs without a
mechanics companion) or `both` if the mutation also propagates into
`design-mechanics.md`.

| Mutation kind | Touches | Mechanical script `--target` | Cold-read scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| `phase1-creation` | `design.md` only when the design will not need a mechanics companion (small designs under ~5 sections), or both files when the design will exceed the length trigger / already plans for mechanics | `design \| both` | `whole-doc` on `design.md` (mechanics is exempt from cold-read since it's agent-targeted) |
| `mechanics-edit` | mechanics only | `mechanics` | **NONE** — cold-read deferred to next `design-sync` |
| `design-sync` | both files (re-distill `design.md` from updated mechanics) | `both` | `whole-doc` on `design.md`, plus mechanics-link-resolution sweep |
| `content-edit` | `design.md` | `design` | `bounded` — changed section + 1-2 surrounding sections + Overview + (when present) Core Concepts |
| `section-add` | `design.md` | `design` | `bounded` — new section + Overview + (when present) Core Concepts + structure roadmap |
| `section-remove` | `design.md` (+ plan / track-file ref cleanup — `**Full design**` lines pointing at the removed section must be updated in the same mutation, otherwise `**Full design**` link resolution fails) | `design` | `whole-doc` |
| `section-rename` | `design.md` + (when mechanics exists) the matching section in `design-mechanics.md` + plan / track-file ref propagation | `design \| both` | `whole-doc` |
| `section-move` | `design.md` | `design` | `whole-doc` |
| `structural-rewrite` | `design.md` + (when mechanics exists and any rename or split propagates) the matching sections in `design-mechanics.md` | `design \| both` | `whole-doc` |
| `length-trigger-crossing` | both files (split into design-mechanics) | `both` | `whole-doc` |
| `phase4-creation` | `design-final.md` + (optional) `design-mechanics-final.md` | `both` if mechanics-final exists, else `design` | `whole-doc` on `design-final.md` (mechanics-final is exempt — agent-targeted long-form). Skip plan / track-file ref propagation: omit `--plan-path` / `--plan-dir` so the cross-file ref check is naturally skipped. |

**Periodic whole-doc check.** Independent of mode: every Nth design-touching
mutation (default `N=5`, counted from the review log) escalates the cold-read
scope to `whole-doc` regardless of the kind. `mechanics-edit` mutations do
NOT increment this counter.

**Two distinct N=5 counters.** Both fire at "5", but they count different
things and trigger different actions; do not collapse them mentally:

| Counter | Counts | Resets on | Triggers |
|---|---|---|---|
| Periodic whole-doc counter | All mutation log entries except `mechanics-edit` | Never resets — running modulo over the log | Cold-read scope is escalated to `whole-doc` for the current mutation, regardless of its declared scope |
| Working-mode counter | `mechanics-edit` entries since the most recent `design-sync` (or since `phase1-creation` if no sync has happened yet) | Resets to 0 on every `design-sync` | The skill surfaces *"5 mechanics edits have accumulated since the last sync — want me to run `design-sync`?"* at the next conversational turn (Step 8) |

See design-document-rules.md:planner,final-designer:1,4 `§ Mutation discipline § Cold-read scope by mutation kind` for the canonical statement of both counters.

## Workflow
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="The mutation loop: apply, distill, scope, check, cold-read (S3-gated for phase1-creation), merge, iterate, log, present." -->

The high-level steps are the same across all mutation kinds; the differences
are in which checks fire and how the cold-read pass is gated. Every kind goes
straight from Step 3 (mechanical checks) to Step 4 (cold-read); there is no
in-skill adversarial pass. The decision/assumption challenge for
`phase1-creation` was relocated onto the research log at the Phase 0 → 1 gate
(D6, `prompts/adversarial-review.md` §Research-log-scoped review (Phase 0→1)),
so for `phase1-creation` the Step 4 cold-read is **gated** behind that
log-adversarial gate clearing (the S3 freeze-order gate; see Step 4) rather
than preceded by a local adversarial step. Every other mutation kind runs the
cold-read with no gate.

### Step 1: Apply the edit
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="Apply the requested mutation to the target design file(s), stamping only on the creation kinds." -->

Use the `Edit` tool (for focused edits) or `Write` (for full-file rewrites or
new section creation). Read the target file first to satisfy the `Edit`
precondition.

For `phase1-creation`: decide first whether the design needs a mechanics
companion. **Default is single file.** Most designs (under ~5 sections,
no `# Part N` headings, no anticipated long-form derivations) seed only
`design.md` — pass `target=design` and leave `design_mechanics_path=null`.
Seed `design.md` with Overview (concept-first elevator pitch), Core
Concepts (when the doc will have Parts or ≥3 new domain terms), Class
Design, Workflow, and TL;DR-shaped Part sections.

Seed both files only when the design genuinely needs the split — typically
when the user has signaled it up front ("this will have a mechanics
companion") or when a single-file seed would already exceed the
2,000-line / 50,000-token length trigger. In that case, pass
`target=both` and `design_mechanics_path=<abs path>`; seed
`design-mechanics.md` with the long-form mechanism content that supports
each `design.md` section, with section names matching between the two
files from the start. A design that doesn't need mechanics on day 1
crosses into one later via `length-trigger-crossing`, not by retroactively
re-running `phase1-creation`.

**Stamp the seeded file(s) with an idempotency guard.** Apply this
directive **after** the initial `Write` lands the seeded content on
disk; the presence check then runs against the just-written file. A
missing file is treated identically to an unstamped file.
`phase1-creation` is the canonical writer for `design.md` (and
`design-mechanics.md` when `target=both`), but `/create-plan`'s
planning-transition step also writes `design.md` directly from its own
template with the stamp already in place. Both invocation paths
converge here, so the directive below must stamp an unstamped file and
skip the prepend on an already-stamped one.

For each path the kind touches (`design_path`; `design_mechanics_path`
as well when `target=both`), run the presence check from
conventions.md:orchestrator,planner,final-designer:1,3A,3C,4 `§1.6(a1)`:

```bash
head -1 <path> | grep -qE '<!-- workflow-sha: [0-9a-f]{40} -->'
```

A zero exit code means the file is already stamped — skip the prepend
for that path (this is the post-`/create-plan` case, where
`design.md`'s line 1 already carries the stamp written by the
planning-transition step's template, or the `target=both` case where
`/create-plan` seeded the dual files and both files already carry the
stamp). A non-zero exit code means the file is unstamped — compute
`$WORKFLOW_SHA` via the `§1.6(b)` paired idiom and prepend
`<!-- workflow-sha: $WORKFLOW_SHA -->` (followed by a newline) above the
H1, then re-read the file to satisfy the next `Edit` precondition:

```bash
WORKFLOW_SHA="$(git log -1 --format=%H HEAD -- .profile-b/workflow .profile-b/skills .profile-b/agents)"
[ -z "$WORKFLOW_SHA" ] && WORKFLOW_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

Compute `$WORKFLOW_SHA` at most once per invocation — when both paths
need a stamp (a direct `phase1-creation` invocation outside
`/create-plan` with `target=both`), reuse the same value so the two
sibling files start life with matching stamps. The guard is symmetric
across `design_path` and `design_mechanics_path`: a same-invocation
run where `/create-plan` pre-stamped one file and the other was added
after (an edge case the guard tolerates by design) is handled by the
per-path presence check.

Cross-session `target=both` may produce non-matching stamps on
`design.md` and `design-mechanics.md` when the `phase1-creation`
invocation lands in a later session than `/create-plan`'s preamble.
The drift gate's no-drift normalization collapses the divergence on
the next clean gate run, and the per-branch migration reunifies the
stamps end-of-migration.

For `phase4-creation`: same as `phase1-creation` but the file paths are
`design-final.md` and (optional) `design-mechanics-final.md`, and the
content reflects what was *actually built* (not the planned design). The
caller (`prompts/create-final-design.md`) is expected to have run the
PSI-backed verification tables before invoking the skill, so each diagram
element traces to a real code location. Do **not** pass `--plan-path` /
`--plan-dir` (the cross-file ref check is naturally skipped; see the
table above). **Skip the idempotency-guarded stamp directive above.**
Phase 4 final artifacts are not stamped: see the Stamp-discipline
blockquote at the top of this file and `conventions.md` `§1.6(f)`.

For `length-trigger-crossing`: split a single-file `design.md` that has
grown past the ~2,000-line / ~50,000-token threshold into the canonical
pair. Caller-supplied `design_mechanics_path` carries the absolute path
of the new sibling file; `target=both`. Move every long-form mechanism
walk-through, full state-machine table, exhaustive worked example, and
file:line citation out of `design.md` and into the freshly-created
`design-mechanics.md`. Keep Overview, Core Concepts, every section's
TL;DR + mechanism overview + edge cases + references footer in
`design.md`; keep diagrams in `design.md` and duplicate any diagram into
`design-mechanics.md` only when the mechanics-side prose needs the same
visual context. Every section name in `design-mechanics.md` matches the
corresponding section name in `design.md` byte-for-byte so that each
section's `Mechanics: design-mechanics.md §"<exact same section name>"`
link resolves and the plan / track-file `**Full design**` references
land in either file by name. See design-document-rules.md:planner,final-designer:1,4 `§ Length-triggered split into design-mechanics.md` for the
canonical split rule.

Stamp the freshly-created `design-mechanics.md` before continuing.
The file is unstamped at creation, so the per-path presence check from
conventions.md:orchestrator,planner,final-designer:1,3A,3C,4 `§1.6(a1)` will always
return non-zero on this path — but applying the guard keeps the
directive symmetric with the `phase1-creation` paragraph above and
tolerates a re-invocation against an already-split pair:

```bash
head -1 <design_mechanics_path> | grep -qE '<!-- workflow-sha: [0-9a-f]{40} -->'
```

A non-zero exit code (the expected case) means the file is unstamped —
compute `$WORKFLOW_SHA` via the `§1.6(b)` paired idiom and prepend
`<!-- workflow-sha: $WORKFLOW_SHA -->` (followed by a newline) above the
H1 in `design-mechanics.md`, then re-read the file to satisfy the next
`Edit` precondition:

```bash
WORKFLOW_SHA="$(git log -1 --format=%H HEAD -- .profile-b/workflow .profile-b/skills .profile-b/agents)"
[ -z "$WORKFLOW_SHA" ] && WORKFLOW_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

The `$WORKFLOW_SHA` value is computed at trigger time, not at the
original `phase1-creation` moment, so the new `design-mechanics.md`'s
stamp can differ from its `design.md` sibling's stamp by however many
workflow-format commits landed between the two creation events. The
asymmetry is expected — the no-drift normalization in the drift gate
collapses the divergence on the next clean gate run, and the
per-branch migration reunifies the stamps when it next runs end-to-end.
`design.md` already carries a stamp from its earlier creation; leave
that stamp byte-for-byte intact (the move of mechanism content from
`design.md` is a `content-edit`-shaped mutation against line 1's
position-preservation contract from `§1.6(a)`). The intra-invocation
SHA reuse rule from the `phase1-creation` paragraph does not apply
here: only `design_mechanics_path` is stamped, and `design.md`'s
line-1 stamp is preserved byte-for-byte under `§1.6(a)`.

For `design-sync`: see Step 1.5 below — sync has a distillation sub-step
before the apply.

Do not retry the apply — if `Edit` fails because `old_string` is not unique
or doesn't match, surface that to the user and stop. The mutation action
does not paper over a malformed edit.

### Step 1.5: Distillation (only for `design-sync`)
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="For design-sync only, re-distill the polished design from the current mechanics companion before the cold read." -->

Sync re-distills `design.md` from the current state of
`design-mechanics.md`. The agent does the distillation:

1. Read the most recent `design-sync` entry in
   `<plan-dir>/design-mutations.md` to find the last sync point.
2. Walk every `mechanics-edit` entry after that point — each entry's "Diff
   summary" tells you what changed in mechanics.
3. For each section in mechanics whose content moved since the last sync,
   update the corresponding section in `design.md`:
   - **TL;DR**: re-write to reflect the current mechanism.
   - **Mechanism overview**: update the prose to match the new mechanics.
   - **Edge cases / Gotchas**: add/remove/edit bullets to mirror mechanics.
   - **References footer**: ensure the `Mechanics:` link still resolves
     and any new D/S codes are listed.
4. For sections **added** in mechanics: create a corresponding section in
   `design.md` following the per-section mandatory shape.
5. For sections **removed** in mechanics: remove from `design.md` (or, if
   the section was renamed, propagate the rename and update the
   `Mechanics:` link).
6. **Update plan / track-file `**Full design**` refs** for any section
   that was added/removed/renamed in this sync — the plan-file checklist
   entries' Decision Records and every track file's `## Decision Log`
   may carry references to the affected section.

Apply the distilled `design.md` to disk via `Edit`/`Write`.

### Step 2: Determine cold-read scope
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="Pick the cold-read scope (bounded or whole-doc) for this mutation kind from the check-set table." -->

Per the table above. For `mechanics-edit`, scope is `none` (cold-read is
skipped) — proceed straight to Step 3 mechanical checks.

For other mutations: track a mutation counter from the review log. Count
all design-touching entries (everything except `mechanics-edit`) since the
log was created. If `count % 5 == 0` (i.e., this is the 5th, 10th, 15th
mutation), escalate the cold-read scope to `whole-doc`.

### Step 3: Run mechanical checks
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="Run the mutation kind's mechanical checks (link resolution, stamp position, section presence) before the cold read." -->

```bash
python3 .profile-b/scripts/design-mechanical-checks.py \
    --design-path <design_path> \
    --design-mechanics-path <design_mechanics_path or omit> \
    --plan-path <plan_path or omit> \
    --plan-dir <plan_dir or omit> \
    --changed-section "<title>" \
    --target <design|mechanics|both> \
    --scope <bounded|whole-doc>
```

Two flags need derivation:

- **`--target`** comes from the cold-read scope table above (column 3).
  When the table writes `design \| both`, resolve to `design` if the
  mutation only edits `design.md` (no `design-mechanics.md` companion
  exists, or the rename / rewrite did not propagate into mechanics)
  and to `both` if both files are touched in this mutation.
- **`--scope`** is the **mechanical-check scope** — orthogonal to the
  cold-read scope conveyed to the sub-agent. Pass `--scope=bounded`
  (and supply `--changed-section`) when column 4's cold-read scope
  starts with `bounded`; the script then runs the per-section shape
  check only on `<changed-section>` instead of every section. Other
  checks (per-section length cap, parenthetical asides, top-level cap,
  mechanics-link resolution, full-design-link resolution, reverse-
  direction refs) always run whole-doc regardless of `--scope`.
  Pass `--scope=whole-doc` for any kind whose cold-read scope is
  `whole-doc` (or for `mechanics-edit`, where there is no cold-read
  but the script still runs in whole-doc mode for the parenthetical-
  aside scan over the mechanics file). The cold-read scope itself is
  passed through the sub-agent prompt's `Inputs` block, not via this
  CLI flag.

For `mechanics-edit`, `--design-path` is still required even though
the `design.md` file is not touched by this mutation kind — it is the
reference for cross-file ref checks and reverse-direction-ref
detection. Treat `design.md` as read-only inputs to the script for
this kind.

The script prints JSON to stdout. Exit code `0` ⇒ no blockers; `1` ⇒ NEEDS
REVISION. Capture and parse the JSON; do not act on the exit code alone —
the findings list is what drives iteration.

### Step 4: Run the cold-read sub-agent
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="Spawn the cold-read reviewer over the scoped sections to catch coherence and self-consistency defects." -->

**Skip cold-read entirely for `mechanics-edit`.** Mechanics is agent-
targeted long-form content, not the human-facing summary; comprehension is
not the discipline that protects it. The next `design-sync` will run
cold-read against the re-distilled `design.md`.

**Skip cold-read when mechanical checks have any `blocker` finding.** No
point asking a sub-agent to assess comprehension if the structure is broken
— iterate on mechanical first, then cold-read once the doc is structurally
sound.

**Block the cold-read for `phase1-creation` while a log-adversarial entry is
open (the S3 freeze-order gate).** Under D6 the decision/assumption challenge
runs as a gate on the research log at the Phase 0 → 1 boundary, not as a local
adversarial pass here. So for `phase1-creation` — before spawning the
cold-read — read the research log's `## Adversarial gate record` section (the
gate's durable verdict carrier; the heading shape and the open/resolved and
latest-dated-entry rules are defined once in `research.md` §The research log
under Gate-record cadence). The gate's own review files under
`_workflow/reviews/` are ephemeral and not the carrier. The gate's verdict is
encoded in the section's headings: when the gate has looped, **match the
latest dated heading**, and a `NEEDS REVISION` heading with any open blocker
or should-fix is an **open** entry. The cold-read **must not run while the
latest log-adversarial entry is open**: that is the S3 invariant — a `design.md`
draft cannot reach cold-read while a log-adversarial entry is open, so a
load-bearing decision surfaced while authoring the design is appended to the
log, re-challenged at the gate, and cleared before the cold-read assesses
comprehension (the same ordering the relocated adversarial pass preserves; see
`design-document-rules.md` § Working / sync). When the gate is clear (every
log-adversarial entry resolved), proceed to the cold-read; the comprehension
pass then assesses a design whose decisions have already survived challenge.

**The S3 gate holds across the D15 batch loop-back.** Once `design.md` is
presented for review, post-presentation findings queue and batch through the
D15 review-iteration loop (`create-plan/SKILL.md` § Step 4 review-hold
batching). A decision-shaped cold-read finding re-enters the gate step — it is
appended to the log and re-challenged — so the gate re-opens and this Step-4
cold-read does not re-run until the log entry is resolved again. There is no
path where the cold-read runs with an open log entry, on the first pass or on
any batch loop-back iteration.

For all other kinds, cold-read is the first and only review pass — there is no
gate. When mechanical has zero blockers (and, for `phase1-creation`, the S3
gate is clear), spawn the cold-read sub-agent via the `Agent` tool:

- `subagent_type`: `general-purpose`
- `description`: `"Cold-read design review (<mutation_kind>)"`
- `prompt`: the full content of `.profile-b/workflow/prompts/design-review.md`,
  with the `## Inputs` block at the top extended by literal substitutions:

```
- design_path: <abs path>
- design_mechanics_path: <abs path or "(none)">
- scope: <bounded|whole-doc>
- bounded_scope: <changed_section name + surrounding section names, when bounded>
- mutation_kind: <kind>
- plan_path: <abs path or "(none)">
- plan_dir: <abs path or "(none)">
```

**Inject `output_path` only for `phase4-creation`.** When
`mutation_kind == phase4-creation`, append one more substitution line so
the Phase 4 cold-read persists its output to a file and returns a summary
(`prompts/design-review.md` § Output format, the path-conditional branch;
the review-file coverage rule in `conventions-execution.md` `§2.5`):

```
- output_path: <abs path under _workflow/plan/ for the cold-read output>
```

For every other kind — including `phase1-creation` — omit the
`output_path` line entirely. The cold-read's no-path branch then returns
inline byte-for-byte today's verdict, so the `phase1-creation` invocation
stays exempt.

**Inject `research_log_path` for `phase1-creation` (the absorption
criterion).** When `mutation_kind == phase1-creation`, append the research
log's absolute path so the cold-read runs the absorption-completeness
cross-check the relocated review needs (D8; the S3 gate has just confirmed the
log's decisions cleared their challenge):

```
- research_log_path: <abs path to _workflow/research-log.md>
```

This is the `target=design` form of the absorption check
(`prompts/design-review.md` §Track-scoped cold-read, the absorption-completeness
criterion that both targets carry): the reviewer confirms that every
load-bearing research-log decision in the design's scope — each
`## Decision Log` entry whose `**Alternatives rejected:**` field names a real
fork — appears as a seed D-record in `design.md`, and that no seed D-record
invents a decision the log never recorded. A missing seed D-record is a
should-fix the Step 6 iterate loop must resolve before the cold-read passes.
Omit `research_log_path` for every other kind (the interactive mutation kinds
and Phase 4 do not run the absorption check).

For `design-sync`, also include in the prompt body: *"This sync re-distills
`design.md` from the current state of `design-mechanics.md`. Verify that every
TL;DR and mechanism overview in `design.md` accurately summarizes the current
mechanics file's content for the same-named section."*

The sub-agent returns a structured Markdown verdict per the prompt's output
format, in one of two shapes split by whether `output_path` was injected
(`prompts/design-review.md` § Output format, the path-conditional branch):

- **`output_path` absent** (the default — every kind except `phase4-creation`):
  the sub-agent returns the full Markdown inline. Parse the **Verdict** line
  (`PASS` or `NEEDS REVISION`) and the inline **Structural findings** list.
- **`output_path` supplied** (`phase4-creation`): the sub-agent returns only
  a summary (the **Verdict** line plus the blocker/should-fix counts) and
  writes the `## Structural findings` detail to the file at `output_path`.
  Parse the **Verdict** and counts from the return, then partial-fetch the
  written file's `## Structural findings` section for the finding detail that
  Step 5 merges.

Map cold-read findings into the same severity schema as mechanical findings.

### Step 5: Merge findings
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="Merge the mechanical-check and cold-read findings into one deduplicated list for the iterate step." -->

Combine mechanical + cold-read findings into a single list. The cold-read
findings are whichever source Step 4 produced: the inline list for the no-path
case, or the `## Structural findings` partial-fetched from the written file
for the `phase4-creation` file-write path. Sort by severity: `blocker` →
`should-fix` → `suggestion`. Mechanical findings carry a structured `rule`
field; cold-read findings are free-form bullets and won't usually duplicate
the mechanical set, but if a cold-read bullet plainly restates a mechanical
finding (same severity, same location, same shape rule), drop the duplicate.
There is no in-skill adversarial finding source to merge: for `phase1-creation`
the decision/assumption challenge ran as the relocated log-adversarial gate
(D6), which Step 4's S3 gate confirmed clear before the cold-read ran, so the
challenge findings were already resolved on the log and never enter this merge.

### Step 6: Iterate
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="Apply fixes and re-run the cold read until findings clear or the iteration cap is reached." -->

Each iteration runs in this order until either the budget is exhausted
or no findings remain:

1. **Address blockers first.** For each `blocker` finding:
   - **`auto_applicable: true`**: the script has flagged this finding as
     mechanically resolvable from its `suggested_fix` text. The
     `auto_applicable` flag does **not** mean a literal regex
     replacement; the agent reads the `suggested_fix` and applies it
     via `Edit`, using the matched substring (e.g., the offending
     `(per D27)` aside) as the `old_string`. The current auto-
     applicable rule is `dsc-parenthetical-aside`.
   - **`auto_applicable: false` (or unset)**: read `suggested_fix` and
     the surrounding context; apply the fix via `Edit`.
2. **Then address `should-fix` findings** in the same iteration, using
   the same auto-vs-manual flow. `suggestion` findings are not retried —
   they are recorded in the review log only.
3. **Re-run mechanical checks; then, if mechanical now passes and
   cold-read was applicable for this kind, re-run cold-read. Replace the
   prior findings list with the new one.** For `phase1-creation`, the S3
   gate still guards the cold-read re-run: a decision-shaped cold-read
   finding addressed this iteration is a log decision (it re-entered the
   gate per Step 4's batch loop-back), so the re-run cold-read only fires
   once the log-adversarial gate is clear again. No mutation kind runs an
   in-skill adversarial sub-agent. The loop's exit conditions below (all
   blocker + should-fix cleared, or budget exhausted) are unchanged.
4. **Decrement the iteration budget.** Stop when the budget reaches
   zero or all blocker + should-fix findings are gone.

Outcomes when the loop exits:

- **All blockers and should-fix findings cleared**: PASS — proceed to
  Step 7.
- **Budget exhausted with blockers remaining**: the action does **not**
  succeed. Leave the partial edits on disk (do not revert), append a
  clear warning to the review log (Step 7 still runs), and present
  findings + diff to the user for manual resolution. The user is the
  gate when the action can't self-correct.
- **Budget exhausted with only `should-fix` findings remaining**: the
  action completes with a warning. Log the unresolved findings and
  proceed to Step 7. The mutation can stand; the residual findings
  carry forward to the next mutation as known debt.

### Step 7: Append to the review log
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="Append the mutation's record to the design-mutations log, which is itself exempt from stamping." -->

Resolve the log path from `mutation_kind` and `design_path` using
the rule below. The log always lives under `_workflow/` so the
Phase 4 cleanup commit reliably removes it; never write the log to
the top-level `<dir>/`.

- **For all mutation kinds *except* `phase4-creation`**:
  `design_path = docs/adr/<dir>/_workflow/design.md` (or
  `design-mechanics.md`), so the plan dir is `design_path`'s parent
  (`docs/adr/<dir>/_workflow/`) and the log lives at
  `docs/adr/<dir>/_workflow/design-mutations.md`.
- **For `phase4-creation`** (special case): `design_path =
  docs/adr/<dir>/design-final.md` (top-level, intentionally
  outside `_workflow/` because `design-final.md` itself is a
  durable artifact). The log path is **not** derived from
  `design_path`'s parent — instead, it is forced to
  `<design_path's parent>/_workflow/design-mutations.md`,
  i.e., `docs/adr/<dir>/_workflow/design-mutations.md`.
  This appends to the existing Phase 1 / inline-replanning log
  under `_workflow/`, preserving the full mutation history of the
  design and ensuring the Phase 4 cleanup commit removes the
  entire log along with everything else under `_workflow/`.

**`design-mutations.md` is not stamped.** Unlike `design.md` and
`design-mechanics.md`, the review log carries no line-1
`workflow-sha` comment — neither at creation nor on later appends.
The log is append-only by contract: a workflow-format commit that
rewrites entries on disk would violate the contract, so the log
is replay-immune by construction and a stamp would be dead weight
on its surface. `conventions.md` `§1.6(f)` lists the file as an
explicit exclusion alongside the Phase 4 final artifacts; the
drift check and the migration both scope to the stamped set in
`§1.6(f)` and skip this file by enumeration. Do not add a stamp
here out of mistaken uniformity with the design files.

Append to the resolved path (create the `_workflow/` directory and
file if they don't exist). Format per
`design-document-rules.md § Mutation discipline § Review log`:

```markdown
## Mutation N — <ISO date YYYY-MM-DD> — <mutation kind> (<design.md | design-final.md>)

**Diff summary**: <one paragraph describing the change>

**Mechanical checks** (target=<design|mechanics|both>): <PASS / N findings>
**Cold-read** (scope: <bounded|whole-doc|skipped>): <PASS / N findings / SKIPPED — mechanics-edit defers cold-read to next design-sync>

**Findings**:
- <severity>: <description>

**Iterations**: <i> of <budget> (PASS | BLOCKER REMAINS | SHOULD-FIX REMAINS)

**Working-mode counter**: <K mechanics-edits since last design-sync> (only for `mechanics-edit` and `design-sync` entries)
```

The header includes the target file's basename (`design.md` for normal
mutations, `design-final.md` for `phase4-creation`) so the log is
unambiguous when an entry follows a Phase 4 entry — both `phase1-creation`
and `phase4-creation` look structurally similar otherwise.

Use `Read` to find the highest existing mutation number and increment by
one. The first mutation is `## Mutation 1 — ...`.

### Step 8: Auto-suggest sync at N=5 (working mode only)
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1 summary="In working mode, suggest a design-sync once five mechanics edits have accumulated since the last sync." -->

After a `mechanics-edit` mutation completes, count `mechanics-edit` entries
in the review log since the most recent `design-sync` (or since
`phase1-creation` if no sync has happened yet). If `count >= 5`:

> Surface to the user at the next conversational turn: *"5 mechanics edits
> have accumulated since the last `design.md` sync. The polished view in
> `design.md` is N edits behind. Want me to run a `design-sync` now, or keep
> iterating?"*

Do not auto-trigger the sync. The user is the gate — they may want to
iterate further before publishing. The suggestion fires once per turn until
either (a) the user says yes (run sync), (b) the user says no/defer (skip
the prompt for this turn; it'll fire again next turn), or (c) a sync runs
(counter resets to 0).

The user can also explicitly request a sync at any count: "let's update
`design.md`", "run design-sync", "publish the polished version" — any
phrasing that conveys intent. Treat the request as authorization to run a
`design-sync` mutation.

### Step 9: Present to the user
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="Present the merged result and surviving findings to the user as the mutation's final output." -->

Show:

1. The diff applied (`git diff <design_path>` or a manual summary if not
   in a git repo).
2. The review-log entry just written.
3. A one-line outcome: `PASS`, `BLOCKER REMAINS — manual resolution
   required`, or `COMPLETE WITH SHOULD-FIX FINDINGS`.

For `design-sync`: also surface a "what changed in mechanics since the
last sync" summary — a bulleted list of the section-level changes the
distillation incorporated, so the user can verify the new polished view
matches their mental model of the iteration.

The action is then complete. The agent returns control to the user / parent
flow.

## Staleness reconciliation
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="The prompt shown when a request references a polished design that mechanics edits have since outpaced." -->

The full Phase 1 lifecycle (sub-phases, sync triggers, working-mode
counter) lives in design-document-rules.md:planner,final-designer:1,4 `§ Two-mode editing — working vs sync`. The one operational protocol anchored here — because that doc
cross-refs to it — is the staleness-reconciliation prompt.

During Phase 1.2 (`mechanics-edit` rounds), `design.md` is **frozen**
relative to mechanics. The user reads `design.md` to review and issues
feedback against it. If the user's request references a `design.md`
statement that mechanics has already moved past, the agent reconciles
explicitly:

> *"Your request references `design.md` saying X. Mechanics has accumulated
> N edits since the last sync, and X has been updated to Y. Should I
> (a) revert mechanics to X then apply your new request, (b) apply your
> request on top of the current state Y, or (c) sync `design.md` first so
> you can see Y, then issue the request?"*

The user picks. Default to (b) when the user's intent is clear and the
delta between X and Y is incidental; default to (c) when the delta changes
the meaning of the request.

## Tools used
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="The tools the skill invokes: the mechanical-check script, Edit/Write, and the cold-read sub-agent spawn." -->

- `Read` — verify file state, read review log for mutation count and last
  sync point.
- `Edit` / `Write` — apply the edit, distill `design.md` during sync, apply
  any auto-fixes.
- `Bash` — run the mechanical-checks script.
- `Agent` — spawn the cold-read sub-agent (skipped for `mechanics-edit`).
- `Edit` (append-mode via full-content read) — write the review-log entry.

## When NOT to use this skill
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="The cases that bypass the mutation discipline: non-design files and pure workflow-artifact edits." -->

- Edits to `implementation-plan.md`, the per-track track files under
  `plan/`, or any other workflow file. Those have their own gates
  (Phase 2 structural review). The `**Full design**` ref-propagation
  that lands in the plan and the track files during a `section-rename`
  or `design-sync` is part of this skill's scope, but isolated plan-only
  or track-file-only edits are not.
- Edits to source code, tests, or docs outside `docs/adr/<plan-dir>/`.
- Pre-Phase-1 scratch notes that haven't been promoted to `design.md`
  yet — only the canonical paths above trigger the discipline.

## Failure modes and recovery
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="How the skill recovers when a check fails, the cold read stalls, or the iteration budget is exhausted." -->

- **Script not found** at `.profile-b/scripts/design-mechanical-checks.py`:
  the project may not have the discipline wired up. Stop and ask the
  user; do not silently fall back to direct `Edit`.
- **Cold-read sub-agent times out or returns malformed output**: re-run
  once. If it fails again, treat the cold-read half as `INCONCLUSIVE`,
  log the result, and continue with mechanical findings only. Add a
  `should-fix` line to the review log noting the cold-read failure.
- **Budget exhausted**: do not loop further. The user is the gate when
  the action can't self-correct.
- **Sync distillation produces an empty diff** (mechanics has no changes
  since last sync): no-op the sync, log a one-line entry noting the
  zero-delta sync, and skip mechanical / cold-read for this round.

## Examples
<!-- roles=orchestrator,planner,final-designer phases=1,4 summary="Worked examples of a content edit and a section rename run through the full mutation discipline." -->

Two intricate cases worth showing concretely. The simpler kinds
(`phase1-creation`, `mechanics-edit`, `content-edit`) follow the
Workflow steps directly with no special handling.

**Example 1 — Sync (`design-sync`).**
After 5 mechanics-edits accumulate, the user says "OK, update
`design.md`". The skill:

1. Reads the review log, identifies all `mechanics-edit` entries since
   the most recent `design-sync` (or since `phase1-creation` if no sync
   has happened yet).
2. Reads `design-mechanics.md` to see the current state.
3. Distills `design.md` — updates each affected section's TL;DR +
   overview + edge cases + references to match current mechanics.
4. Updates plan / track-file `**Full design**` refs for any renamed /
   added / removed sections.
5. Runs mechanical checks with `--target=both`.
6. Spawns cold-read with `whole-doc` scope, including the sync-specific
   "verify `design.md` reflects current mechanics" instruction.
7. Iterates as needed.
8. Appends `Mutation N — ... — design-sync` to the review log; the
   working-mode counter resets to 0.
9. Presents the user a "what changed in mechanics since last sync"
   summary alongside the diff and log entry.

**Example 2 — Section rename (`section-rename`).**
The user asks to rename `## DPB (D33)` to `## Architectural redesign: Dirty Page Bitset (D33)`. This design has a `design-mechanics.md`
companion, so the rename has to propagate. The skill:

1. Applies the rename `Edit` in `design.md`.
2. Updates the matching section name in `design-mechanics.md` — per
   the "section names match" rule in
   `design-document-rules.md` § Length-triggered split into
   `design-mechanics.md`.
3. Updates every `**Full design**: design.md §"DPB (D33)"` line in
   `implementation-plan.md` and in every `plan/track-N.md` track file
   to use the new name.
4. Runs mechanical checks with `--target=both`, `--scope=whole-doc` —
   confirms zero broken refs. (`both` because mechanics was touched;
   the cold-read scope table resolves `design \| both` to `both` for
   this case.)
5. Spawns cold-read with `whole-doc` scope.
6. Logs and presents.

If the design has **no** `design-mechanics.md` companion, step 2 is
skipped and step 4 runs with `--target=design`. Step 3 still runs —
plan / track-file ref propagation is independent of whether mechanics
exists.
