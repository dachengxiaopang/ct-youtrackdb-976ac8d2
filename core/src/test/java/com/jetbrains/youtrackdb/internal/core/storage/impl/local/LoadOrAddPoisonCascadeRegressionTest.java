/**
 * Integration regression test for the original "poison cascade" bug
 * (https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/YTDB-823 et al.): a concurrent-insert workload on
 * a freshly-built indexed class would trip an
 * {@code IllegalStateException("Page X:Y was allocated in other thread")} that the storage
 * layer then translated into {@code StorageException("Page Y is broken in file …")}, after
 * which subsequent operations cascaded into "Internal error happened in storage" failures.
 * The structural fix (read-cache concurrency contract on {@code WOWCache.loadOrAdd}, the
 * I4 sentinel, and the per-component allocator-only AOBT contract) closes the discovery
 * channel that allowed the race; this test pins the closure end-to-end and end-to-cache.
 *
 * <p>Two scenarios are exercised here:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>High-level concurrent-insert smoke test
 *       ({@link #concurrentInsertWorkloadCompletesWithoutPoisonCascade}).</b> Opens a
 *       fresh disk-mode {@code YouTrackDB} instance with {@code checksumMode=StoreAndThrow}
 *       (the magic-check leg of the bug is silenced when checksums are off — this leg
 *       must stay green under the production-default checksum stance). Creates a class
 *       with an indexed string property — its backing cluster's
 *       {@link com.jetbrains.youtrackdb.internal.core.storage.collection.v2.PaginatedCollectionV2}
 *       and {@code CollectionPositionMapV2} are the canonical contention surfaces from the
 *       bug ticket. Spawns {@link #THREADS} concurrent transactional inserts (capped at
 *       16 per the Phase A risk-review consensus so dev workstations and CI runners
 *       produce comparable timing profiles), each thread runs {@link #ITERATIONS}
 *       inserts via {@code executeInTx}. Asserts none of the documented failure shapes
 *       fire (allocator-mismatch, magic-stamp, "Internal error happened in storage").
 *       After the workload finishes, reopens the storage and verifies every committed
 *       record is readable.
 *
 *       <p>Positive-evidence assertion: instrumented {@link LongAdder} counters on
 *       {@link WOWCache#getLoadOrAddExtendBranchInvocationsForTest} +
 *       {@link WOWCache#getLoadOrAddGapFillBranchInvocationsForTest} are split into two
 *       independent assertions. The extend branch is the steady-state allocator path
 *       under a healthy workload, so it must fire at least {@link #THREADS} times. The
 *       gap-fill branch must not scale with the workload — a low single-digit count
 *       is acceptable (cross-component snapshot races between independent allocators
 *       on different files can momentarily route a follow-up call through gap-fill
 *       without indicating a regression), but a count comparable to the extend total
 *       would signal a cascading mis-route from extend onto gap-fill. Splitting the
 *       assertions means a future regression that silently re-routed inserts from the
 *       extend path to the gap-fill path (or away from {@code loadOrAdd} altogether)
 *       fails loud — pooling the counters would let such a regression "pass" the
 *       absence-of-symptom check for the wrong reason.
 *
 *   <li><b>Deterministic white-box reproducer
 *       ({@link #whiteBoxLoadOrAddSameKeyContentionConverges}).</b> A repeated-rounds
 *       harness driving two threads against the production read-cache wrapper's
 *       {@code loadOrAddForWrite} → {@code WOWCache.loadOrAdd} path under a
 *       {@link CyclicBarrier} start-gate, fresh fileId per round (so each round
 *       starts from {@code currentSize == 0} and the extend branch is the only legal
 *       allocator path), {@value #WHITE_BOX_ROUNDS} rounds. Each round runs both
 *       threads through the read cache with {@code verifyChecksums = true} (the
 *       production setting under {@code checksumMode=StoreAndThrow}). The wrapper's
 *       {@code data.compute} segment write lock serialises the two threads at the
 *       {@code AsyncFile.allocateSpace} / cache-pointer install boundary; both
 *       threads must observe the same {@link CachePointer} instance and the cache
 *       must end the round in a consistent state.
 *
 *       <p>Going through the wrapper rather than the bare {@link WOWCache#loadOrAdd}
 *       surface is intentional: the wrapper-coordinated path is what production
 *       inserts traverse, and the test pins the success-mode contract on that path
 *       (one extend, one published pointer, both readers observe it). The cache-layer
 *       I4 sentinels (the {@code "allocated pageIndex … does not match"} extend-branch
 *       throw and the {@code "allocated start index … does not match currentSize"}
 *       gap-fill-branch throw, both {@link IllegalStateException}) are exercised
 *       deterministically by direct reflective invocation of the private branch
 *       helpers with a Mockito-doctored {@code File} in
 *       {@link com.jetbrains.youtrackdb.internal.core.storage.cache.local.WOWCacheLoadOrAddConcurrentTest#extendBranchSurfacesI4SentinelWhenAllocatedIndexAboveRequested}
 *       and
 *       {@link com.jetbrains.youtrackdb.internal.core.storage.cache.local.WOWCacheLoadOrAddConcurrentTest#gapFillBranchSurfacesI4SentinelWhenAllocatedStartIndexAboveCurrentSize}.
 *       Together the two tests cover the cache-layer fast-fail (deterministic
 *       reflection) and the wrapper-coordinated success path (here).
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Verification protocol (recorded in the commit message).</b> The smoke test was
 * verified to fail on the unmodified develop branch by cherry-picking this commit onto
 * {@code origin/develop} and running with {@code ./mvnw -pl core clean test
 * -Dtest=LoadOrAddPoisonCascadeRegressionTest}; the precise reproduction rate is captured
 * in the squashed-PR description. On this branch (the structural-fix tree) the same
 * invocation passes 10/10 consecutive runs.
 *
 * <p><b>Test class naming.</b> The class uses the {@code Test} suffix (rather than
 * {@code IT}) so that surefire's default include patterns ({@code *Test.java},
 * {@code *Tests.java}, {@code *TestCase.java}) match it under standard
 * {@code ./mvnw -pl core clean test} invocations. The
 * {@code @Category(SequentialTest.class)} annotation routes it through the
 * sequential-tests surefire execution (configuration mutates
 * {@code GlobalConfiguration.STORAGE_CHECKSUM_MODE} indirectly via the per-instance
 * builder and exercises shared cache primitives). Comparable concurrency tests in
 * this package — {@code AbstractStorageDeadlockFixTest},
 * {@code EdgeSnapshotLifecycleTest}, and {@code FreezeAndDBRecordInsertAtomicityTest}
 * (under {@code core/db}) — follow the same naming convention.
 *
 * <p><b>Sequential category.</b> The test runs under {@link SequentialTest} because it
 * sets {@code GlobalConfiguration.STORAGE_CHECKSUM_MODE} via the per-instance
 * configuration, opens a disk-mode YouTrackDB instance, and exercises the storage's
 * WOWCache primitive directly. Parallel forks touching the same build directory would
 * interfere with each other's file allocation accounting.

  /**
   * Two-thread repeated-rounds harness driving the production read-cache wrapper's
   * {@code loadOrAddForWrite} surface at the same {@code (fileId, pageIndex == 0)}.
   * {@value #WHITE_BOX_ROUNDS} rounds, each with a fresh fileId so each round drives
   * the extend branch fresh. The {@link CyclicBarrier} start gate maximises
   * contention at the wrapper's {@code data.compute} → {@code WOWCache.loadOrAdd}
   * → {@code AsyncFile.allocateSpace} install boundary.
   *
   * <p>The wrapper's {@code data.compute} segment write lock serialises the two
   * threads: exactly one enters the lambda first, takes the extend branch on
   * {@code WOWCache.loadOrAdd}, installs the {@link CachePointer} into the
   * {@code data} map, and returns; the second worker either hits the cache-hit fast
   * path (entry already in the map) or enters the lambda after publication and
   * observes the existing entry. In both cases the returned {@link CachePointer} is
   * identity-equal to the one the first worker installed.
   *
   * <p>Invariants pinned per round:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Both threads succeed. The wrapper's segment lock and the in-cache
   *       publish-before-release ordering guarantee no thread observes a
   *       partially-stamped page.
   *   <li>Both workers return the same {@link CacheEntry} instance (the underlying
   *       cache map serves one entry per {@code (fileId, pageIndex)}). Distinct
   *       {@code CacheEntryImpl} wrappers would signal a regression in the
   *       cache-install path even when the {@link CachePointer} happens to match.
   *   <li>Both returned {@link CacheEntry} instances share the same
   *       {@link CachePointer} instance (verified via {@link IdentityHashMap}).
   *   <li>Exactly one extend happened: the file holds exactly one physical page on
   *       this round's fileId.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Pinning {@code CachePointer.referrersCount} would be a fourth defense-in-
   * depth check, but {@link CachePointer} does not expose a public getter for the
   * count (only mutators {@code incrementReadersReferrer} /
   * {@code decrementReadersReferrer}); the wrapper's lock-and-release contract is
   * indirectly pinned by the cache-entry identity check above (a leaked referrer
   * after release would surface in tear-down via the DirectMemory track-mode
   * assertions, not here).
   *
   * <p>A regression that broke the wrapper's segment-lock serialisation would
   * surface here as either two distinct {@link CachePointer}s (each worker extended
   * independently) or a physical page count of two on at least one round. A
   * regression that re-introduced the underlying allocator-mismatch poison cascade
   * would surface as an {@link IllegalStateException} propagated out of
   * {@code loadOrAddForWrite}.
   *
   * <p>The {@code wowCache.loadOrAdd} primitive is exercised through the wrapper
   * here with {@code verifyChecksums = true} (the production setting under
   * {@code checksumMode=StoreAndThrow}). The cache-layer I4 sentinels (extend and
   * gap-fill branches) are exercised deterministically by reflection-driven
   * Mockito mocks in
   * {@link com.jetbrains.youtrackdb.internal.core.storage.cache.local.WOWCacheLoadOrAddConcurrentTest#extendBranchSurfacesI4SentinelWhenAllocatedIndexAboveRequested}
   * and
   * {@link com.jetbrains.youtrackdb.internal.core.storage.cache.local.WOWCacheLoadOrAddConcurrentTest#gapFillBranchSurfacesI4SentinelWhenAllocatedStartIndexAboveCurrentSize}
   * — see that class's Javadoc for the failure-mode coverage map. This test is the
   * production-shape counterpart: success-mode invariants on the wrapper-coordinated
   * path, repeated to catch intermittent regressions.
