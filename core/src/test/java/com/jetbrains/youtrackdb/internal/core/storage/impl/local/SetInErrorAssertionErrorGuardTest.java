/**
 * Pins the {@link AbstractStorage#setInError(Throwable)} entry-point guard that
 * skips {@link AssertionError}. The guard is the third defense-in-depth layer
 * behind the broadened pre-{@code endTxCommit} catch at
 * {@link AbstractStorage#commit} and the broadened catches in the four
 * {@code AtomicOperationsManager} wrappers. It closes the residual cascade
 * vector left by those two layers: any {@link AssertionError} that escapes a
 * top-level storage method (such as {@code synch}, {@code freeze},
 * {@code release}, or ~30+ siblings) hits the outer {@code catch (Error)}
 * block, descends through {@code logAndPrepareForRethrow(Error, true)}, and
 * reaches {@code setInError}. Before the guard, that path put the storage into
 * a permanent error state; after the guard, it logs and rethrows but leaves
 * {@code isInError()} false so the storage stays usable for subsequent commits.
 *
 * <p>Note that not every {@code catch (Error)} site in {@code AbstractStorage}
 * is in scope here: roughly 35 of the ~140 sites use the two-arg
 * {@code logAndPrepareForRethrow(Error, false)} overload (e.g., {@code count}),
 * which disables the read-only-mode flip entirely and so never calls
 * {@code setInError}.
 *
 * <p>Production behavior is unchanged: the JVM default is {@code -ea OFF}, so
 * {@code assert} statements never fire in shipping deployments. The test JVM
 * runs with {@code -ea} (see {@code core/pom.xml}), making the guard
 * exercisable here.
 *
 * <p>The companion storage cascade-containment test (see the corresponding
 * later step in this track) exercises the same guard end-to-end via the four
 * engine-mutator clamp+error path. This test focuses on the
 * {@code setInError}/{@code logAndPrepareForRethrow} surface in isolation,
 * invoking the {@code protected} {@code logAndPrepareForRethrow} overloads
 * (the production callers of the {@code private} {@code setInError} setter) on
 * a freshly-opened storage with each of the relevant {@link Throwable}
 * subtypes.
