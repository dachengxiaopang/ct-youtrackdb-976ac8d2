/**
 * Pins the invariant that a rolled-back atomic operation never reaches
 * {@code commitChanges} (the write-path half of the rollback-leaves-no-physical-
 * footprint property).
 *
 * <p>This is the load-bearing assumption behind the open-time orphan-pass gate
 * added by YTDB-1039. {@code AbstractStorage.open} now runs the recovery-time
 * orphan-truncation pass only when this open replayed the WAL (the
 * {@code wereDataRestoredAfterOpen} dirty gate). That gate is safe only if a
 * cleanly-closed disk database can never carry a physical orphan, and the only
 * way a transaction produces a physical footprint (an {@code AsyncFile} extend, a
 * dirtied real cache page, an {@code EnsurePageIsValidInFileTask}) is inside
 * {@link AtomicOperation#commitChanges(long, WriteAheadLog)}. If a rolled-back
 * operation could reach {@code commitChanges}, a rolled-back-then-cleanly-closed
 * session could leave an orphan on disk, and the dirty gate would skip a pass
 * that was actually needed.
 *
 * <p>The guard that enforces this lives in
 * {@link AtomicOperationsManager#endAtomicOperation(AtomicOperation, Throwable)}:
 * {@code commitChanges} is invoked only inside the
 * {@code if (!operation.isRollbackInProgress())} block, and a production
 * {@code assert} at that call site re-states the negation so a future refactor
 * that merged the branches, moved the call, or weakened the rollback predicate
 * trips a test under {@code -ea} instead of silently breaking the gate. The
 * {@code assert} lines are excluded from JaCoCo coverage by the project coverage
 * gate, so the regression value lives here, in the spy-based assertions below,
 * not in the {@code assert} alone.
 *
 * <p>Both rollback entries into {@code endAtomicOperation} are covered:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the inbound-error path — {@code endAtomicOperation} is entered with a
 *       non-null {@code error}, which flips the operation into rollback before
 *       the persist hook and the commit gate; and
 *   <li>the index-delta-persist-failure flip — the success-path persist hook
 *       ({@code persistIndexCountDeltas}) throws, and its catch flips the
 *       operation into rollback so the subsequent commit gate is skipped.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Each rollback test asserts that none of the commit-only side effects of
 * {@code endAtomicOperation} ever fire on a rolled-back operation: not
 * {@code commitChanges}, and not the commit-branch table/WAL calls
 * ({@code commitOperation}, {@code persistOperation}, and the WAL
 * {@code addEventAt} record). A positive control asserts {@code commitChanges}
 * IS invoked on a clean success path. The control exists to falsify a specific
 * vacuous-pass mode: if a future change made the clean success path unreachable
 * (for example {@code mockOperation} defaulting the operation into rollback, or
 * the commit gate being removed), the {@code never()} assertions in the two
 * rollback tests would pass on every path and silently stop guarding anything;
 * the positive control fails in that case and surfaces the regression. A second
 * positive control stubs {@code commitChanges} to return a non-null
 * {@code LogSequenceNumber} so the durable-commit {@code addEventAt} branch is
 * actually exercised; the first control leaves {@code commitChanges} unstubbed
 * (null LSN) and so only reaches the {@code persistOperation} else-branch, which
 * would leave the rollback tests' {@code addEventAt} {@code never()} assertions
 * referencing a branch no test ever runs.
 *
 * <p>The overlap with {@link EndAtomicOperationPersistHookTest} is INTENTIONAL.
 * That sibling pins the full persist-hook conversion contract (error-mode
 * transition, exception-type wrapping, lock-release ordering, dual-invocation
 * latch) across many cases; this class is the dedicated, narrowly-named
 * regression anchor for the single rollback-leaves-no-physical-footprint premise
 * that the open-time orphan-pass gate depends on. Keeping it separate means a
 * future maintainer who weakens that gate finds a test named for exactly the
 * premise they broke, rather than a buried assertion inside a broad persist-hook
 * suite. Do not delete this class as accidental duplication of the sibling.
 *
 * <p>The property has a second, read-extend half (no correct production read
 * extends a file outside crash recovery). That half is a component-correctness
 * invariant, not assertable at this seam, and is documented in the gate comment
 * in {@code AbstractStorage.open}; it is deliberately out of scope for this test.
