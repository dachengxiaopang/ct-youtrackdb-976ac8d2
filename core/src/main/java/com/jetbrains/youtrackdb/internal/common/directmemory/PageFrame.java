/**
 * A pooled page-sized direct memory frame with an associated {@link StampedLock}.
 *
 * <p>Frames are recycled via {@link PageFramePool}, not deallocated during normal operation.
 * This guarantees that any Java reference to a PageFrame always points to valid mapped memory
 * (protective memory allocation). Speculative reads may hit stale data, but never unmapped
 * memory.
 *
 * <p>The StampedLock enables three access modes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Optimistic read</b> — {@link #tryOptimisticRead()} + {@link #validate(long)}.
 *       No CAS, only volatile reads. Used by the pinless read path.</li>
 *   <li><b>Shared lock</b> — {@link #acquireSharedLock()} / {@link #releaseSharedLock(long)}.
 *       Used by the CAS-pinned fallback read path and WOWCache copy-then-verify.</li>
 *   <li><b>Exclusive lock</b> — {@link #acquireExclusiveLock()} /
 *       {@link #releaseExclusiveLock(long)}. Used by write operations, eviction (to invalidate
 *       stamps), and pool acquire/release (stamp invalidation barrier).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Page coordinates ({@code fileId}, {@code pageIndex}) are set under exclusive lock when
 * the frame is assigned to a page. Optimistic readers verify coordinates match the expected
 * page to detect frame reuse.
