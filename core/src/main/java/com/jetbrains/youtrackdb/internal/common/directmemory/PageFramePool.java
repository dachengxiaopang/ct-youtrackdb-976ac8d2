 * even when frames are pooled, so any speculative read from a stale PageFrame hits valid
 * memory.
 *
 * <p>When pool capacity is exceeded, excess frames MAY be deallocated — but only after
 * acquiring the exclusive lock (invalidating all outstanding optimistic stamps). The
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.StampedLock} itself lives on the Java heap, so
 * {@link PageFrame#validate(long)} is always safe to call regardless of native memory state.
 *
 * <p><b>Critical ordering:</b> readers MUST call {@code validate()} before ANY read from the
 * buffer after taking the stamp. The StampedLock's acquire fence ensures the stamp check is
 * visible before any subsequent memory access.
