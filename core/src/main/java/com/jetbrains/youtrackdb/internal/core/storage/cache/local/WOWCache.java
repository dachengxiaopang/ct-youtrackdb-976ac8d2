/**
 * Write part of disk cache which is used to collect pages which were changed on read cache and
 * store them to the disk in background thread. In current implementation only single background
 * thread is used to store all changed data, despite of SSD parallelization capabilities we suppose
 * that better to write data in single big chunk by one thread than by many small chunks from many
 * threads introducing contention and multi threading overhead. Another reasons for usage of only
 * one thread are
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>That we should give room for readers to read data during data write phase
 *   <li>It provides much less synchronization overhead
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Background thread is running by with predefined intervals. Such approach allows SSD GC to use
 * pauses to make some clean up of half empty erase blocks. Also write cache is used for checking of
 * free space left on disk and putting of database in "read mode" if space limit is reached and to
 * perform fuzzy checkpoints. Write cache holds two different type of pages, pages which are shared
 * with read cache and pages which belong only to write cache (so called exclusive pages). Files in
 * write cache are accessed by id , there are two types of ids, internal used inside of write cache
 * and external used outside of write cache. Presence of two types of ids is caused by the fact that
 * read cache is global across all storages but each storage has its own write cache. So all ids of
 * files should be global across whole read cache. External id is created from internal id by
 * prefixing of internal id (in byte presentation) with bytes of write cache id which is unique
 * across all storages opened inside of single JVM. Write cache accepts external ids as file ids and
 * converts them to internal ids inside of its methods.

  /**
   * Total page-access primitive: returns a usable {@link CachePointer} for the given
   * {@code (fileId, pageIndex)} regardless of whether the page already exists on disk.
   *
   * <p>The implementation reads the in-memory {@link AsyncFile} size once into
   * {@code currentSize} (in pages) and dispatches to one of three branches:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@code pageIndex < currentSize} &mdash; <b>load existing</b>. Acquires the
   *       per-{@link PageKey} shared lock from {@code lockManager} (the same lock today's
   *       {@code load} takes to serialize against {@code doRemoveCachePages} and
   *       {@code flushExclusiveWriteCache}), probes the dirty {@code writeCachePages} map
   *       first &mdash; if a more recent dirty pointer is sitting there, returning it takes
   *       priority over an older on-disk version &mdash; and falls through to
   *       {@code loadFileContent} on miss. The {@code loadFileContent}-returns-null branch
   *       is defensive dead code today: with {@code pageIndex < currentSize} the test
   *       {@code fileClassic.getFileSize() < pageEndPosition} cannot fire, because both
   *       sides read the same in-memory {@link AsyncFile#getFileSize}. The fallback is
   *       preserved to absorb future divergence (sparse-region misses, DWL recovery flows
   *       that surface a null) without breaking the totality contract.
   *   <li>{@code pageIndex == currentSize} &mdash; <b>one-page extend</b>. Calls
   *       {@link AsyncFile#allocateSpace} (atomic {@code getAndAdd}), submits a single
   *       {@link EnsurePageIsValidInFileTask} on the {@code wowCacheFlushExecutor}
   *       (single-threaded, FIFO order across submissions), and returns a freshly-allocated
   *       empty {@link CachePointer}. The {@code lockManager} shared lock is <b>not</b>
   *       taken here: a freshly-installed pointer cannot race with concurrent flush until
   *       the caller's outer {@code data.compute} segment write lock publishes it.
   *   <li>{@code pageIndex > currentSize} &mdash; <b>multi-page gap-fill</b> (recovery
   *       only). Calls {@link AsyncFile#allocateSpace} once for {@code (pageIndex -
   *       currentSize + 1) * pageSize} bytes, submits an
   *       {@link EnsurePageIsValidInFileTask} for every gap page in
   *       {@code [currentSize, pageIndex]}, and returns the {@link CachePointer} for the
   *       requested {@code pageIndex} only. The intermediate gap pages are stamped on disk
   *       but not held in the read cache. Like the extend branch, the {@code lockManager}
   *       shared lock is not taken: the caller's outer {@code data.compute} segment write
   *       lock publishes the freshly-installed pointer before any concurrent flush could
   *       observe it.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>Totality contract.</b> The method never returns {@code null} for any open,
   * non-deleted file. The only way the contract breaks is if the file was concurrently
   * deleted by an unrelated thread, in which case {@code loadFileContent} surfaces an
   * {@link IllegalArgumentException} that propagates raw to the caller as a caller-bug
   * signal &mdash; the totality contract holds for the documented usage (caller still owns
   * the fileId). A defensive {@link IllegalArgumentException} guard at the dispatch prelude
   * also fires when the dispatch prelude itself observes a missing entry for {@code fileId}
   * before {@code loadFileContent} would have a chance to.
   *
   * <p><b>Caller precondition.</b> The caller holds the segment write lock for the
   * {@code (fileId, pageIndex)} key. The production caller is
   * {@link com.jetbrains.youtrackdb.internal.core.storage.cache.chm.LockFreeReadCache#doLoad},
   * shared by {@code loadForRead} and {@code loadOrAddForWrite}, which calls this method from
   * inside {@code data.compute(fileId, pageIndex, ...)} so the segment write lock is held
   * across the call. Lock ordering inside this method:
   * acquire {@link #filesLock} read lock; on the load branch additionally acquire the
   * {@code lockManager} shared lock for the {@link PageKey}; the dispatch prelude opens
   * one {@code files.acquire(fileId)} cycle and the chosen branch reuses the same handle
   * (load branch releases before delegating to {@code loadFileContent}, which re-acquires
   * internally; extend / gap-fill branches keep the handle open across
   * {@link AsyncFile#allocateSpace}).
   *
   * <p><b>Magic stamp.</b> The returned {@link CachePointer} on the extend / gap-fill
   * branches contains an in-memory empty buffer with LSN {@code (-1,-1)}; the on-disk
   * magic stamp is written asynchronously by {@link EnsurePageIsValidInFileTask}. The
   * task is idempotent (it only writes when the underlying file is shorter than the page
   * offset), so resubmissions on the gap-fill branch are safe.
