   * <p>The method dispatches to one of three branches depending on whether

   * size (in pages):
   * <ul>
   *   <li><b>Load existing</b> ({@code pageIndex < currentSize}) &mdash; returns the
   *       existing on-disk (or dirty-write-cache) page. On the disk engine this acquires
   *       the per-{@link com.jetbrains.youtrackdb.internal.core.storage.cache.local.PageKey}
   *       shared {@code lockManager} lock (same policy as the legacy {@code load});
   *       the in-memory engine has no equivalent lock.</li>
   *   <li><b>One-page extend</b> ({@code pageIndex == currentSize}) &mdash; atomically
   *       extends the file by one page via {@code AsyncFile.allocateSpace}, submits an
   *       {@link com.jetbrains.youtrackdb.internal.core.storage.cache.local.EnsurePageIsValidInFileTask}
   *       on the single-threaded FIFO {@code wowCacheFlushExecutor}, and returns a
   *       freshly-allocated magic-stamped empty {@link CachePointer}.
   *       The {@code lockManager} shared lock is <b>not</b> taken on this branch: the
   *       freshly-installed pointer is published only after the caller's outer
   *       {@code data.compute} segment write lock releases it.</li>
   *   <li><b>Multi-page gap-fill</b> ({@code pageIndex > currentSize}; recovery only)
   *       &mdash; allocates space for the entire gap in one batched call, submits one
   *       {@code EnsurePageIsValidInFileTask} per gap page in {@code [currentSize,
   *       pageIndex]}, and returns only the target page's {@link CachePointer}. Gap-fill
   *       is the recovery-only branch; callers under normal operation always target
   *       {@code pagesSize + 1} (from the component's {@code entryPoint}), so
   *       {@code pageIndex > currentSize} can only occur during WAL replay.
   *       The {@code lockManager} shared lock is not taken here either, for the same
   *       reason as the extend branch.</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>Caller precondition.</b> For the disk engine: the segment write lock for the
   * {@code (fileId, pageIndex)} key must be held by the caller &mdash; that is, the call
   * must originate from inside a {@code LockFreeReadCache.data.compute} lambda. The
   * in-memory engine ({@code DirectMemoryOnlyDiskCache}) enforces its own install-or-fetch
   * atomicity via {@code MemoryFile.loadOrAddPage} without a segment lock.
   *
   * <p><b>Totality contract.</b> The method never returns {@code null} for any open,
   * non-deleted file. An {@link IllegalArgumentException} is thrown &mdash; not a null
   * return &mdash; if the file has been concurrently deleted or was never registered;
   * that is a caller-bug signal. Any {@link java.io.IOException} from the underlying disk
   * I/O propagates raw.
   *
   * <p><b>Runtime invariant.</b> Under normal (non-recovery) operation the caller computes
   * the target {@code pageIndex} from {@code entryPoint.pagesSize + 1}: the logical page
   * count on the component's {@code EntryPoint} metadata page, which is bumped only on
   * commit inside the same WAL atomic unit. This guarantees {@code pageIndex ==
   * currentSize} on the extend branch; the gap-fill branch is structurally unreachable
   * until the write-side API collapse rewires the WAL replay loops.
   *
   * <p><b>FIFO + monotonic submission.</b> {@code EnsurePageIsValidInFileTask} submissions
   * for a given {@code fileId} are monotonically increasing in {@code pageIndex} by
   * construction (the per-component lock serializes concurrent allocators). Combined with
   * the single-threaded FIFO executor, this guarantees that every gap page in
   * {@code [old_size, pageIndex]} is stamped in order; no interior zero page can survive
   * across a crash. See design.md §"Crash safety" for the three crash scenarios and
   * their walk-throughs.
   *
   * @param fileId external file id of the target page
   * @param pageIndex zero-based page index inside that file; must be &ge; 0
   * @param verifyChecksums whether checksum verification is enforced on the load branch
   * @return a non-null {@link CachePointer} positioned at the target page
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code pageIndex < 0} or the file is deleted /
   *     never registered
   * @throws IOException if the underlying disk I/O fails
   * @apiNote <b>Per-component-lock contract on the extend / gap-fill branches.</b>
   *     Callers reaching the extend or gap-fill branch (i.e. allocating a fresh
   *     {@code (fileId, pageIndex)}) MUST hold the per-component exclusive lock on the
   *     {@code StorageComponent} that owns {@code fileId}, acquired via {@code
   *     AtomicOperationsManager.executeInsideComponentOperation} /
   *     {@code calculateInsideComponentOperation} (which internally call {@code
   *     acquireExclusiveLockTillOperationComplete}). The per-component lock is what
   *     serialises two concurrent transactions that share the same {@code fileId} on the
   *     same component — without it, both transactions can race past the snapshot read of
   *     the file's logical page count and submit the same {@code pageIndex} to this method,
   *     tripping {@link IllegalStateException} from the cache's allocator-uniqueness check
   *     ({@code "Page X:Y was allocated in other thread"}).
   *
   *     <p>Production-reachable hot paths that share a {@code fileId} across concurrent
   *     transactions — {@code CollectionPositionMapV2.allocate} (wrapped by {@code
   *     PaginatedCollectionV2.allocatePosition}), {@code
   *     PaginatedCollectionV2.allocateNewPage}, and {@code
   *     IndexHistogramManager.writeSnapshotToPage} — are pinned by the {@code
   *     ProductionAllocatorConcurrencyMTTest} suite under {@code
   *     core/src/test/.../storage/impl/local/paginated/atomicoperations/}.
   *
   *     <p><b>Coverage shape of the MT pins.</b> The CPMV2 / PCV2 entry points
   *     ({@code PaginatedCollectionV2.allocatePosition},
   *     {@code PaginatedCollectionV2.createRecord} on the {@code allocateNewPage} branch)
   *     hold TWO locks at the allocator site: the AOM per-component lock acquired by
   *     {@code calculateInsideComponentOperation}, and an inner
   *     {@code acquireExclusiveLock()} on the same {@code SharedResourceAbstract}
   *     instance. Reentrancy makes the inner call a no-op while the AOM lock is held.
   *     The MT pin therefore only fails on a "both-locks-dropped" regression — a
   *     single-direction regression that drops only the AOM-level wrap (the documented
   *     contract above) is masked by the inner {@code acquireExclusiveLock}, because
   *     the inner per-component {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock}
   *     still serialises the two threads and the test passes even though the contract
   *     has been broken at the AOM layer. The IHM
   *     ({@code IndexHistogramManager.writeSnapshotToPage}) caller is single-locked
   *     (AOM only, via {@code acquireExclusiveLockTillOperationComplete} directly), so
   *     a regression at the AOM layer there fails the suite without ambiguity.
   *     Component initialisers that run once per index/component lifecycle (e.g.
   *     {@code BTree.create}, {@code SharedLinkBagBTree.splitRootBucket}) are not
   *     reachable from concurrent session-level transactions and rely on the same
   *     per-component-lock contract rather than on a dedicated MT regression gate.
   *
   *     <p>Load-branch ({@code pageIndex < currentSize}) callers do not require the
   *     per-component lock for safety from this method's perspective; the per-page
   *     {@code lockManager} shared lock covers concurrent reads. The lock contract above
   *     applies to allocator-shaped uses.

   * triggering writes from other threads while paused, otherwise pages
   * may still be written to disk during the pause window.
   *
   * <p>Intended for tests that need to read raw storage files without racing
   * with the periodic flusher (torn-page hazard). Not part of any
   * production-runtime contract. The default is a no-op for in-memory and
   * mock implementations that have no background flusher.
