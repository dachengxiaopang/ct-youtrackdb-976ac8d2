/**
 * A scheduled traversal of a single {@link PatternEdge} in a specific direction.
 * <p>
 * While {@link PatternEdge} records the **syntactic** direction of an edge as written in
 * the `MATCH` expression, the topological scheduler (see
 * {@code MatchExecutionPlanner#getTopologicalSortedSchedule()}) may decide to traverse the
 * edge in either direction depending on cost estimates and dependency constraints.
 * `EdgeTraversal` captures this decision:
 * <p>
 * - **{@link #out} = `true`**  → traverse from `edge.out` to `edge.in` (forward / as
 *   written).
 * - **{@link #out} = `false`** → traverse from `edge.in` to `edge.out` (reverse).
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Syntactic:     (p) ──out('Knows')──→ (f)
 *                       PatternEdge.out=p, PatternEdge.in=f
 *
 *   Scheduled forward:  EdgeTraversal.out=true   → start at p, traverse to f
 *   Scheduled reverse:  EdgeTraversal.out=false  → start at f, traverse to p
 * </pre>
 *
 * Additionally, the planner annotates each `EdgeTraversal` with the **source node's**
 * class, RID, and `WHERE` filter (the "left" constraints). These are used by
 * {@link MatchReverseEdgeTraverser} to validate the target records when traversing in
 * reverse.
