/**
 * Immutable point-in-time snapshot of index statistics and histogram.
 *
 * <p>Represents committed state only. Replaced atomically on transaction commit
 * (delta application) and on histogram rebalance. Stored in a shared
 * {@code ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, HistogramSnapshot>} keyed by engine ID.
 *
 * <p><b>Immutability contract:</b> This record is treated as deeply immutable.
 * The {@link EquiDepthHistogram} and {@link HyperLogLogSketch} instances
 * referenced by this record must <b>NOT</b> be mutated after construction.
 * In particular, callers must never call {@link HyperLogLogSketch#add},
 * {@link HyperLogLogSketch#merge}, or {@link HyperLogLogSketch#rebuildFrom}
 * on a sketch obtained from a snapshot — doing so would corrupt shared state
 * visible to concurrent planner threads.  When a new snapshot is needed (e.g.,
 * during delta application), the sketch must be {@linkplain
 * HyperLogLogSketch#copy() copied} first, then mutated on the copy.
 * {@link IndexHistogramManager#computeNewSnapshot} enforces this pattern.
 * The contract is enforced by convention, not by the type system — no
 * defensive copies are made on the read path to avoid allocation overhead.
 *

 * @param mutationsSinceRebalance  number of put/remove operations since last

 * @param totalCountAtLastBuild    totalCount at the time of the last histogram
 *                                 build; used to compute the rebalance threshold
 * @param version                  incremented on each rebalance; used by delta

 *                                 because in-flight transactions are rolled back

 *                                 the rebalance threshold to be halved. NOT
 *                                 persisted — resets to false on restart and
